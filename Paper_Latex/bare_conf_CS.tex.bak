% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Android fragmentation has been a controversial topic, but both proponents and opponents cannot provide strong evidences to support their statements. In order to make the debate more clear, we mined and analyzed the Android bug reports related to two popular Android vendors, HTC and Motorola. We manually annotated bug reports with labels and applied Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the datasets to produce bug topics. By comparing the average relevance of top 20 bug topics over time for both vendors, we categorized the topics into two types which are common topics and unique topics. We investigated and discussed these two types of bug topics relevance tendency over time. Our analysis results lead to the conclusion that Android fragments into multiple incompatible and brand-specific versions. Our findings can be used by Android system community, stakeholders, Android device vendors and developers to make project dashboards, process investigation and feature analysis.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
The market share of mobile phones is always increasing and getting more and more competitive among various mobile device vendors\footnote{\url{http://asymco.com/2011/11/17/the-global-smartphone-market-landscape}}. iPhone and Android phone share the majority of mobile device market. Compared to Apple’s closed ecosystem for iOS, Android system has many fragmentation. These fragmentation highlights include Android five major versions, diverse customized Android versions and various Android mobile devices provided by different device vendors \cite{androidfragmentation}.

Android fragmentation has been a controversial topic which swells up now and again. Some people argue that there should be many issues about the fragmentation on Android platform. They hold the point that there are too many existing Android versions, various Android mobile devices running these versions and too many branches from multiple vendors \cite{androidfragmentation}\cite{timetoendfragmentation}. On the other hand, there is an opposite viewpoint that there is no issues about fragmentation in Android community, only differentiation \cite{googleschmidt}\cite{androidcompatibility}. However, both proponents and opponents cannot provide strong evidences to support their statements.

In order to make this debate more clear, we will explore the bug topics for different vendors from Android bug reports using Labeled LDA [1]. We choose the bug reports of HTC and Motorola in this study. HTC’s first Android phone was the HTC Dream manufactured in Oct. 2008. HTC has made more than thirty different Android phones since then. Motorola made their first Android phone in Oct. 2009 and has released more than twenty different Android phones since then . Their Android products have gained widespread popularity. 

In this study, our goal is to investigate the topics in bug reports related to the two Android vendors, HTC and Motorola, with the purpose of understanding how their bug topics evolve over time.  We utilize the Labeled LDA, a novel technique in software engineering, to build the topic models and analyze the topic evolution models\cite{Thomas:2010} of bug reports in HTC and Motorola. Researchers have applied LDA and other topic models to a lot of software projects\cite{Marcus04aninformation}\cite{Asuncion:2010}\cite{Linstead:2009}\cite{Thomas:2011}. We will also apply LDA on our data and try to evaluate the performance between LDA and Labeled LDA.

This paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce the Labeled LDA to build topic models.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item We empirically compare the performance of LDA and Labeled LDA on the bug reports of HTC and Motorola.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item We analyze the topic evolution models in Android platform for HTC and Motorola by mining their bug reports.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Our findings support that Android community does have fragmentation issues.
\end{itemize}

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the background; we discuss the related work in section 3; in section 4, we explicate our methodology about the mining approaches applied on this study; section 5 is to compare and evaluate the topic models generated by LDA and Labeled LDA; we introduce the analysis of topic evolution models in section 6; the paper concludes with a discussion of two research questions, threats to validity, conclusion and future work in section 7, 8 and 9 correspondingly.

\section{Background}
In our research, we apply Labeled LDA to perform topic analysis. Labeled LDA is a supervised topic model for credit attribution in multi-labeled corpora\cite{labeledlda}. It defines a one-to-one mapping between LDA’s latent topics and tags labeled by users. In other words, Labeled LDA incorporates the multiple tags into the topics learning process and only builds topics around these tags, which is quite different from LDA. LDA, as a totally unsupervised algorithm, automatically learns a set of terms for each topic on a corpus without any constraints. To apply Labeled LDA, we utilize the Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox (STMT)\cite{stmt}. Specifically, this tool outputs a set of topics, each one consisting of a list of terms, and the relevance distribution between each bug report and all the topics.

%\end{figure*}



\section{Related Work}
Topic models have been used to help understand software systems. Marcus et al.\cite{Marcus04aninformation} used Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) on both source code and user queries and then identified the most relevant source code documents with similarity measurements. Asuncion et al.\cite{Asuncion:2010} applied a coherence measurement on topics learned by LDA to model the quality of bug reports. Linstead et al.\cite{Linstead:2009} performed LDA to generate traceability links for artifacts in software projects automatically. Topic modeling is also utilized by Thomas et al.\cite{Thomas:2011} to study the evolution of topics in software projects.

Compared with all these approaches, our work differs from them in two aspects. We manually labeled bug reports with multiple labels. And we applied labeled LDA in our work to overcome the disadvantages of these unsupervised algorithms by pre-defining the number of topics and interpreting the extracted topics \cite{Asuncion:2010}.

\section{Methodology}
Our methodology is to extract bug reports, assign multiple labels to each of them and then perform Labeled LDA on the labeled data. In order to compare the performance between LDA and Labeled LDA, we also apply LDA on the extracted bug reports of HTC and Motorola without our manual labels. We label all the topics generated by LDA. For each vendor, we calculate the similarity of each pair of labels from LDA and Labeled LDA to evaluate their performance. After that we calculate the average relevance of bug reports to each label over time\cite(Hindle) and compare them between two Android vendors, HTC and Motorola.

\subsection{Generating the data}
We use the Android bug reports provided by the MSR Mining Challenge \cite{MSRChallenge2012}and store all the XML data into a SQL Server. Using regexes, we extract bug reports highly related to Android phones of HTC and Motorola respectively. We use the title, opened date and description in each bug report. After removing all the declined and duplicate bug reports, we have 1503 HTC bug reports and 1058 Motorola bug reports.

\subsection{Multi-labeling}
We manually tag bugs with multiple labels. The labels are defined as the functionalities 
and applications on an Android mobile phone, such as SMS/MMS, browser and Wi-Fi or the components of the handsets mentioned in the bug reports, such as GPS, screen and keyboard. Most of the labels about functionalities and applications are based on the detailed introduction to the features, specifications and applications of Android operating system\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_operating_system}}. The labels about components of the handsets are mostly extracted from the description of comparison of Android devices\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_devices}}.

First, two of us (Zhang and Fan) separately tag the HTC 248 bug reports in 2009 with the multiple labels. Then we train each author’s labeled data with STMT. By comparing each set of trained topics in the results and returning to the bug reports, we check to ensure the same interpretation of each bug when labeling. Then we come up with the same labeling rules to process the data. After this, we tag the rest of bug reports separately for both HTC and Motorola. When there is a bug report that cannot be tagged by the labels we already have, we would create a new label together based on our definition of labels, i.e. the functionalities and applications on an Android mobile phone or the components of the handsets. For example, the label “calculator” is created by this way. At first we could not expect this basic application on mobile phones would have bugs. However, there are several bugs that complained the correctness of the calculator’s results. So we added it to our labels. The manual labeling took approximately 30 hours per person. In the end, for HTC and Motorola there are 199 and 73 bug reports that cannot be labeled respectively. We have tagged 1304 HTC and 985 Motorola bug reports, each with multiple labels. In total, there are 72 labels for HTC and 57 labels for Motorola. Table I selects Manual labels from bug reports of HTC and Motorola. There are at least 20 bug reports are assigned to these labels.

\subsection{Applying Labeled LDA}
To apply Labeled LDA we preprocessed the labeled bug reports. We convert the title and description of each bug report to lowercase and remove stop words (words that are less than 3 characters and common English stop words such as ``all'', ``about'', ``the'', ``that'' and ``were'' ).
By applying Labeled LDA to the bug reports of HTC and Motorola separately, we have the word distribution of each label and a matrix that provides the relationship between bug reports and the labels. The topic analysis is based on these results. In order to investigate the trend of each label by time, we grouped all the bug reports by month from 2009 to 2011 based on their open date for each of the two vendors. For each label, we computed the average relevance values of bug reports to this label in each month. The average relevance value of a label \begin{math} \l_i \end{math} in month \begin{math} m_j \end{math} is the sum of all the relevance values of this label over all bug reports in this month divided by the number of bug reports in this month,
\begin{equation}
A(\l_i,m_j) = \frac{\sum_{\substack{k=1}}^{|m_j|}r(\l_i,d_k)}{|m_j|}
\end{equation}
where r(l,d) is the relevance value of label l to bug report d, $|m_j|$ is the number of bug reports in this month. This metric is to sum all the relevance values. At last we generated a distribution of average relevance among 36 months for each label.

\subsection{Applying LDA}
In order to compare the performance between LDA and Labeled LDA, we also apply LDA on the extracted bug reports of HTC and Motorola without our manual labels. We used the same preprocessing method on the HTC bug reports when applying LDA. 
To choose the number of topics $n$, we ran LDA using multiple values of n that included: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 on the bug reports of HTC. Three of the authors evaluated the word distribution of each topic together in each case. We then chose the n is equal to 35 where the topics generated by LDA were distinct enough from each other, had few repetitions and could be interpreted well by the authors. Other researchers had the some similar results [papers about choose n]. We did the same process on the bug reports of Motorola and we chose the number of topics is equal to 30. We also labeled each topics generated by LDA for both vendors and the labels are based on our manual labels. Three of the authors annotated the topics together and it took two hours in total to finish all the labeling work.


\subsection{LDA vs. Labeled LDA}
Both of the results from LDA and Labeled LDA are the matrices that provide the relationship between bug reports of two vendors and the labels. We want to explore whether LDA would generate the similar results to Labeled LDA. That is if the topics generated by LDA that were labeled as the same ones in Labeled LDA would be related to similar bug reports.
The Jaccard similarity coefficient is applied to compute the similarity between each topic in LDA and each label in Labeled LDA. That is, the Jaccard similarity coefficient between label A in LDA and label B in Labeled LDA is the ratio of the intersection of bug reports related to label A and label B to the union of the bug reports related to topic A and label B,
\begin{equation}
sim(A,B) = \frac{\phi(A,d)\bigcap\phi(B,d)}{\phi(A,d)\bigcup\phi(B,d)}
\end{equation}
Where the $\phi(A,d)$ is the set of bug reports that has relevance values to label A.

We used several thresholds (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) on the relevance value of a bug report to a label in LDA when generating the Jaccard similarity coefficient and found that under the threshold is 0.2 the result is best.

\section{Performance of LDA and Labeled LDA}
We investigate the performance between LDA and Labeled LDA in this section.

From these two similarity plots of labels between LDA and Labeled LDA, we can observe that most of the topic-label similarity values are quite small except the diagonal ones, especially in HTC. This observation is expected since most of the diagonal spot are the Jaccard similarities between the same labels from LDA and Labeled LDA. Then we counted the number of bugs that are related to labels which are both shared by LDA and Labeled LDA. 

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{htcsim.png}
\caption{Similarity of labels between LDA and Labeled LDA in HTC. X axis is the labels in Labeled LDA and Y axis is the labels of topics generated by LDA. The result is based on the HTC bug reports. Brighter means higher similarity.}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{motosim.png}
\caption{Similarity of labels between LDA and Labeled LDA in Motorola. X axis is the labels in Labeled LDA and Y axis is the labels of topics generated by LDA. The result is based on the Motorola bug reports. Brighter means higher similarity.}
\end{figure*}

Most of the same labels from LDA and Labeled LDA have comparable amount of bug reports. For example, the label “calling” from the HTC bug reports has exactly the same number of bugs related to for both results of LDA and Labeled LDA. However, the similarity of these related bug reports in terms of this label “calling” is very low which means LDA and Labeled related quite different bug reports to this label. When doing this comparison, we cannot ignore the number of bugs that related to each label from both two techniques. That is, for one label, the ratio (the small number is divided by the big number so the ratio is always less or equal to one) of the number of bug reports related to this label predicted by LDA and Labeled LDA would be the upper bound of the similarity value. This means that the relation between topics and each bug report modeled by LDA is quite different from the results generated by Labeled LDA.

The similarity values for these labels are quite low compared with the ratio. Only about ten labels in HTC have similarity values that are larger than half of the ratio. For Motorola, the similarity values are all very low compared with the upper bound of the similarity values.

From all above, we can conclude that only a few of the bug reports in HTC and Motorola are predicted by LDA and Labeled LDA to be related to the same labels. In other words, the relation between topics and each bug report modeled by LDA is quite different from the results generated by Labeled LDA. We think the manual efforts of labeling all the bug reports would help us gain the better topic models generated by Labeled LDA. Hence we chose to use the Labeled LDA to do topic analysis in the following sections.

\section{Topic Mining and Analysis}
In order to investigate the compatibility and stability of fragmentation of android system, we mined the bug report of Android System and analyzed the result from both quantity and quality views. 

This section describes the results of topic mining Android bug reports.

\subsection{Overview of bug reports in HTC and Motorola}
We start by exploring the quantity of bug reports for HTC and Motorola. We group the bugs monthly based on their opened date and count the total number of bugs in each month for two vendors. Figure 1 depicts a comparison of the quantity of bugs for HTC and Motorola.

Observing Figure1, we can proceed to answer the following questions

\begin{itemize}
\item Is there any time correlation between the first opened bug report and the first released Android phone of both vendors?

Figure1 shows the first HTC bug report was opened in January, 2009, and the first Motorola bug report was opened in November, 2009. According to the brief history of Android phone survey [1], HTC released the first Android phone in October, 2008, while Motorola releases the first phone in October, 2009. The first bug reports of both vendors are in order of the first phone released by them.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Do both vendors have the same market reaction?

Comparing the bug report distribution and Android phone release history for HTC, there is a one-year time span between the first Android phone released in October, 2008 and the peak number of bug report in October, 2009. For Motorola, there is only a one-month time span between the first Android phone release in November, 2009 and the peak number of bug report in November, 2009. The longer market reaction is due to the debut of each new technology should undergo the course of recognition. The observation that Motorola got its peak value of bug reports in such a short time springs from Android system has already been recognized by smart phone market. So it easily brought about the boom period with the fruit from HTC.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Do both vendors have the same bug report distribution over time?

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{commontopic.png}
\caption{Common Troubled Topics in HTC and Motorola}
\end{figure*}

Examining the bug report distribution of HTC over time, we can see there are two notable ups and downs. The watershed of these two waves is February, 2010. The date is close to the release time of HTC Nutex One, which is the first HTC phone based on Android 2.1 announced in January, 2010 [1]. All phones released before this date was based on Android 1.x. So each wave indicates the bug report distribution for one Android major version. The first wave is mainly for bug reports in Android 1.5, and the second one is for Android 2.1. These two waves with similar tendencies indicate that the bug report distribution of each Android version experienced the same life cycle in HTC Android phones. For Motorola, there is no regular spikes and drops like HTC. The different bug report distribution would be caused by the different Android phone support. Comparing with the shed of Android 1.x and 2.x supported by HTC, Motorola announced its Android phones with Android 1.5 and 2.x at the same time. With two major versions support in the same period, the bug report distribution seems to be smooth over time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Topics Analysis of HTC and Motorola}

First, it should be mentioned that we got 72 topics for HTC and 58 topics for Motorola with Labeled LDA. A representative subset of top 20 topics, which are obtained by sorting the number of related bug reports for HTC and Motorola respectively, is given in Table 1. Each topic is described by top 10 terms associated with the topic concept for both HTC and Motorola. These topics cover 85\% bugs of HTC, and 83\% bugs of Motorola. 

From Table 1, we can see that HTC and Motorola share many identical terms for each label. For instance, we found both vendors have the same terms for Bluetooth such as connection, headset and calling issue. For HTC, this topic happened frequently for the Desire model on both Android 2.1 and 2.2 versions. For Motorola, Bluetooth bugs happened frequently for the Droid with Android 2.2. 

Examining the label column of Table1, it is clear that various functions of the Android phone are represented. With the assistance of these associated terms for each topic, we come up with a concrete analysis for each topic and investigation of the relations among the topic relevance, the Android phone release of each vendor and the Android system evolution.

By analyzing the topic distribution among bug reports, we got the average relevance for each topic by month. Examining the average relevance trends for each topic and comparing them for both vendors, we categorize the topics into three types. They are common troubled topic, common improved topic, and unique topic.


\subsubsection{Common Troubled Topics}

The Common Troubled Topic means that the relevance of topic has fluctuations all the time for both HTC and Motorola. Figure1 shows the average relevance of a representative subset of 8 common troubled topics for HTC and Motorola over time. The observation that the relevance of the eight topics fluctuates all the time for both vendors indicates that the functions in Android phone for both vendors have problems through.

In fact, each function cannot exist individually, and many functions have to correlate with others. New features introduced are sure to affect other related functions as well. In order to interpret the various topic evolutions and find out the story behind each topic, we here bring up with some cases about correlation among multiple functions and some functions with new technologies.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{fixtopic.png}
\caption{Common Improved Topics in HTC and Motorola}
\end{figure*}


\begin{itemize}
\item SMS\//MMS

Based on the bug reports, problems of SMS in both vendors in the early days are mainly about basic functions, such as ``deleting multiple messages causes phone freezes'', ``randomly delete all the text'' and so on. Afterwards, the upgrade from Android 2.1 to Android 2.2 results in SMS cannot work well any more. In addition, with the upgrade between major releases or minor release, some new introduced features related with SMS lead to some problems. For example, the support of synchronization between phone and other platform brought in some bug reports about SMS synchronization [6].
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Contact

In Android 1.6 [2], a new feature called Quick Search Box, which provides the search function from contact brought in some problems for Contacts. In Android 2.2[2], the new feature that Bluetooth can share contacts with other phone also contributed some problems.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Calendar

According to the bug reports, Calendar experienced from the problem of incorrect display and reminders to the problems caused by synchronization between the phone and Google application or other platform.
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Email

Similar with Calendar and Contact, it underwent the basic function problems and then other problems caused by the combination of synchronization and Android applications.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bluetooth

Bluetooth experienced the upgrade of the Bluetooth techniques itself. When Bluetooth 2.1 was introduced in Android 2.1, lots of the bug reports were opened with blue tooth, which was consistent to the two spikes in Figure 1. In the meanwhile, a new feature in Android 2.2 [2] that supports voice dialing over Bluetooth, share contacts with other phones, and Bluetooth enabled car and desk docks results in problems of other functions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Setting

Setting, as the manager of configuration of many functions, it is definitely affected when the new functions are introduced, or the basic features are enhanced.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Layout

Similar with Setting, Layout relates with all functions from the user interface level. It is clear in Figure1 that the relevance is kept higher level over time.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Common Improved Topic}

The Common Improved Topic means that the relevance of topic turns to be flat after several fluctuations over time for HTC and Motorola. It can also be interpreted as these functions tend to be more robust over time with Android evolution during the whole observed period. 

Figure 2 shows the average relevance of a representative subset of 6 common topics for HTC and Motorola over time. Inspecting Figure 2, we can obtain that both vendors have spikes for these six functions.

\begin{itemize}
\item The first time of spikes

The peak relevance for the topics ``calling'', ``audio'' and ``android market'' arose in 2009, while ``browser'' and ``image'' arose in 2010. The observation that the peak value for both vendor occurs in different period stems from the different released time of Android phone from both vendors.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of spikes for each topic

Topic ``keyboard'' and ``browser'' have two peak values. This observation is consistent with the enhancement of Android 1.x to 2.x. In Android 2.0, there is a concrete description about the improvement and enhancement of these two functions [2]. The problem in old version and the adoption of the enhancement in the beginning contribute to these two peaks. The problems in other topics only happened in the early days for HTC, which indicates most problems exist in Android 1.x. Later on, they turned to be flat in Android 2.x.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Unique Topic}

The Unique Topic means that the relevance of topic has significant difference between HTC and Motorola. It can also be interpreted as these functions cannot work well for specific vendor. 

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{uniquehtc.png}
\caption{Unique Topics relevance in HTC}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{uniquemoto.png}
\caption{Unique Topics relevance in Motorola}
\end{figure*}

Every vendor has its own branches of Android system [3], even though they base on the same version of Android system. Therefore, it cannot be avoided that there are some specialty issue for different vendors.
	
Figure 3 shows the average relevance of a representative subset of 2 common topics for HTC over time.


\begin{itemize}
\item Language

Comparing with Motorola who has no bug reports associated with language, Language function should be the specific issue for HTC Android phone. It is implicated by the associated terms of Language topic that issues were caused by the upgrade from Android 2.1 to Android 2.2 in HTC Desire. In fact, the original Android version in HTC Desire is Android 2.1. The keyboard multiple language function [2] is a new function introduced in Android 2.2. Most of HTC Android phone has no physical keyboard, so this new function has been used frequently by HTC users. In contrast, for Motorola, most of Android phones have the physical keyboard, so this function was used seldom.
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item WiFi

Based on the news report [4], WiFi is a public problem for HTC Android phone. The main problem is the security. In addition, Android 2.2 provides a new feature of the portable WiFi hotspots. This can be the evidence of two spikes for HTC. By Comparison, the relevance of WiFi in Motorola is smooth. This indicates that WiFi in HTC Android phone is a little weaker. 
\end{itemize}

Figure 4 shows the average relevance of a representative subset of 2 common topics for Motorola over time.

\begin{itemize}
\item GPS

Figure 4 represents that the relevance of GPS in Motorola is higher than that in HTC. Considering the total number of bug reports of HTC and Motorola, it indicates that there are more bug reports associated with GPS topic which makes it as a unique topic. GPS support in Android system evolved from assisted GPS (A-GPS) to the Google Map. HTC has only one peak relevance; in contrast, Motorola has four spikes. This indicates that GPS support in Motorola branches of Android is not robust.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Upgrade

Upgrade have problems for both vendors, it represents two peak values for Motorola. This observation origins from there are mainly two upgrade cases [5], the first one is from Android 1.x to 2.x, the second one is from Android 2.0 to 2.x. Motorola released Android phone based on both Android 1.x and Android 2.x at the same time. Comparing with HTC which only evolves from Android 2.0 to 2.x, it is obvious that Motorola have more updates issues occurred than that in HTC. The various updates make “Upgrade” as a unique topic for Motorola.
\end{itemize}

In summary, common troubled topics and common improved topics for both vendors are caused by defects and evolution of functions in Android system. Some unique problems for each vendor show that the branch of Android from each vendor has its own problems. Even though Android system has some defects in each version, if the vendor can make the best of software and hardware during design, they can win better performance. The typical case is the Keyboard. Virtual keyboard is supported in Android system, but it had problems in the early stage. Most of HTC Android phones adopt the virtual keyboard, while Motorola is prone to physical keyboard. As a result, HTC gets more issues in the topics which relates with Keyboard, while Motorola avoided the problems. The different choices have already been exposed by the bug reports.


\section{Discussion}

Comparing to Apple’s closed ecosystem for iOS, Android system has many existing fragmentations. These fragmentations include Android systems with five major versions, which are Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, and Ice Cream Sandwich, Andriod system running in devices in various sizes, which from smart phone to TVs, and customized Android system from device vendors[3].

Some people argues that there should be many fragmentation issues since there are too devices running different operating systems [3][7]. On the other hand, there is an opposite viewpoint that there are no fragmentation issues [8][9].	

In this session, we want to discuss this question and try to give a reasonable answer based on our analysis.

\subsection{Does Android have fragmentation issues?}

In this paper, the fragmentations of Android system involved in the bug reports are Android 1.x, 2.x and branches of Android systems on multiple devices in HTC and Motorola. 

According to the analysis result, common troubled topics existing in both HTC and Motorola Android device indicates that no matter how different the Android system is and how different the device is, the topics turns to be up and down all the time. Common-Improved topics of both HTC and Motorola indicate that the issues are caused by the fragmentation of Android system with different version and that of Android system from branches of both vendors. Unique topics for HTC and Motorola indicate that the issues are caused by the branches of Android system in vendor side. 

Besides the three topics, upgrade issues in both vendors can also be an evidence of fragmentation issues. Before upgrading Android system on their devices, each vendor should evolve their own branch of Android system based on the combination of the original version on that device and the latest Android system. The issues that some functions did not work after upgrade could be eliminate by one piece of maintenance of Android system. 

Therefore, we can conclude that Android system has fragmentation issues.

\subsection{Who can benefit from the Topic analysis?}

In this paper, the topic analysis suggests the robust and evolution of functions in Android system on devices from different vendors. The analysis result can be used by different people.
	
For Android system community, the findings enable them to find out what functions have severe problems, and what functions have fewer problems, what functions correlated with each other have more problems. It can also make them to distinguish problems of vendors from others. In addition, the clear idea about the problems of vendors makes community to realize what should be documented and emphasized in corresponding documentations. The concrete and detailed documentation can help reduce the chance of fragmentation issues.

For stakeholders, the findings make them have a whole picture about the function robust of their devices. In the meanwhile, they can also get information about other vendors. With the comparison of the same topics between two vendors, other vendors can easily get some lessons learn which guide them during design and customizing their own system.

For developers, the findings make them know how robust these functions. Furthermore, combining correlation among different functions in the code level and the functions trends from bug reports, they can easily find out what functions have potential bugs.

\section{Threats to validity}

Data validity – Our data originated from MSR dataset and the dataset only ranges from January, 2009 to September, 2011. In addition, we extracted the bug report of HTC and Motorola with regular expression, which cannot ensure 100\% correctness extraction. 

Reliability – During labeling the bug reports, every annotator followed the same protocol and used the same labels. However, there were only two annotators working on the labeling work. The annotation could be biased considering the few number of annotators and the limited knowledge we would have.	

Analysis validity - The lack of information about the various devices for two vendors in bug reports makes it difficult to analyze the fragmentation of Android system on various devices for vendors. The analysis in this paper mainly focuses on the fragmentations of various Android Systems and main fragmentation for each vendor.


\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper we studied the Android bug reports for two Android vendors, HTC and Motorola. Based on topic analysis using Labeled LDA on a corpus of manually tagged bug reports with multiple labels, we revealed common troubled topics, common improved topics for both vendors and unique topics for each vendor. Our results show that Android system has some fragmentation issues. These findings can be used by Android system community, stakeholders, Android device vendors and developers to make project dashboards, process investigation and feature analysis.

For our future work, we will plan to investigate more vendors in order to reveal vendor specific bug topics and get more concrete fragmentation issues analysis.
