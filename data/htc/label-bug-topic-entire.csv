3708,notification,"Fri, 28 Aug 2009 21:42:08 +0000",OnSensorChanged() is no longer called in standby mode since last Firmware upgrade.,"I have a service that uses the accelerometer to detect movement, and up until recently this has worked fine when the device was in standby. It has been regularly tested on HTC G1 and Magic and tested specifically to work under these conditions, but it seems that a recent Firmware upgrade may have broken this (my Magic stopped working in this scenario since the last firmware I think, a few weeks ago). I have recently acquired an HTC Hero and this also fails to get the notifications. What seems to occur now, is that the SensorEventListener.OnSensorChanged() messages are not occuring at all in standby, and they continue once the device is switched back on. The application also checks for other changes such as GPS location changes, and these continue to work in standby, so I would expect the sensor messages to also continue to get through as they did previously, and the SDK documentation doesnQ'Et state it shouldnQ'Et work in standby. This change has effectively broken my Android Market application, which is designed to protect the device from being moved/removed, and therefore this renders its functionality seriously compromised once the device goes into standby. Could someone advise when this will be fixed, as it is starting to affect my sales. Thank you."

I did reproduce it on both the emulator (SDK 1.5_r2) and my HTC Magic (Firmware version 1.5, kernel version 2.6.27-00393-g6607056, build number CRB43). Steps to reproduce: 1. Create AudioTrack (STREAM_MUSIC, MODE_STATIC) for PCM data from any wav file (example one attached) 2. start playback by calling AudioTrack.play() 3. try replaying the sound by calling the following sequence: audioTrack.stop(); audioTrack.reloadStaticData(); audioTrack.setPlaybackHeadPosition(0); audioTrack.play(); 4. repeat step 3 very fast a few times 5. if nothing is wrong yet, then wait for a few seconds, and try step 3 again. I tried with various sounds, including very short ones (0.125 second), same result. Expected results: When replaying existing audio track, the current sound playback should stop.

4561,ringtone contact,"Sat, 07 Nov 2009 17:38:14 +0000",Ringtone and contact assignment problem,"HTC MAGIC Firmware version: 1.6 Kernel version: 2.6.29-00479-g3c7df37 Build Number:DRC 92 Unrooted User since 28 Oct 2009 Ringtone assignment on my magic appears to be erratic especially when a do the following: 1. Open Music Player 2. Use Android Market 3. Mount and Unmount MicroSD card or connect to PC through USB 4. Delete any content from card. These comments are what I posted to the Vodafone forum on the HTC Magic: On Ringtone Assignment on an Unrooted HTC Magic:- HTC Magic Unrooted upgraded from Cupcake ( 1.5) to Donut (1.6) I am experiencing the same issue with ringtones and contacts. It may sound like a minor issue but has become a major annoyance. Ringtone assignment strikes me as a basic feature. I have tried using Ringo Pro to solve the problem. Ring Pro can be made the default application for handling ringtones and contacts. I can apply ringtones to contacts, play them back and test them. I have observed this peculiarity though. When ever I open the music application to play MP3s or Ogg Vorbis files, the ringtones are knocked out of alignment and the default plays instead. It mysteriously reverts. I read on one site that the original ringtone manager has to be set to silent. I have tried this also. It does the same with Ringo Pro and Rings Extended. Apparently, the ringtones live in a directory called media on the SD card (i.e /sdcard/media/audio/ringtones. They are also visible in the usual list accessible through the menus. This needs to be addressed. I find the HTC Magic a great and attractive device but marred by flaws like this. My 3 year old Nokia N73 allowed for flawless ringtone assignment. Like the HTC, it too had a system of ROM memory accompanied by a writable volume -, the MiniSD card. Yet the HTC Magic handles ringtones very anarchically. Has anyone else experienced this? This post has been edited by droidston: Nov 4 2009, 04:32 PM and.. Q""EA discovery through experimentation... After formatting my MicroSD card, backing all the media content before doing this, I created a directory called /ringtones. This directory contained the Android collection of tones plus a few of my MP3s. What I did next was rename MP3 ringtone items and on my PC before placing in the /ringtones folder.This included scrubbing all tagging info by right-clicking on the file and clicking Q'EpropertiesQ'E summary and advanced. This renaming makes the MP3s distinct from those in the /Music directory. I switched the HTC Magic off, turned it on again and made Ringo Pro my default ringtone picker. I assigned the tunes to the contacts. I mentioned in my earlier post that whenever i went into the media player the assignment of ringtones to contacts would collapse. This has not happened since I did the above. Well, not yet! I got mum to ring me and her picture and assignment ringtone came up. I opened the media program again, played a few songs and quit the application. I had someone ring me and the assigned tone played as desired. ItQ'Es all still under observation. BUT..., two things can screw the ringtones to contacts assignments * downloads from the Android market. Weird * Mounting and unmounting the MicroSD card. As a long time (mostly) Linux user I hate to say this but Android 1.6 is broken. This simple yet essential aspect of the phone needs fixing.Q""E Well, the same issue has recurred since this last attempt to solve this problem myself. Assigned contacts ring with the default ring. Android seems to have a problem indexing preferences of the above kind and like the issues concerning alarms ( which I have also experienced)they need resolution. Other users have experienced this also with both Cupcake and Donut. The HTC Magic is good device in terms of the physical hardware but it is for me a half smartphone since I would like to use the Music Player as an MP3/Ogg Vorbis player but cannot since the assigned ringtones fall into disarray when I attempt to and most pressing of all I cannot know who is calling me until I physical pick up my phone. Ringtone assignment is vital in how I use my device."

If you *must* have the phone wake up, then at least have it wake up instantly so I can instantly put it back to sleep before putting it in my pocket.

2882,input,"Fri, 05 Jun 2009 08:48:59 +0000",  IME options behavior is inconsistent across different devices  ,"Affects: 1.5 R1 Summary: The imeOptions attribute on TextViews behaves inconsistently across different devices. For instance, setting imeOptions to Q""EnormalQ""E has the following effects: 1) On the emulator and G1s running 1.5: The OSK will have a Q""EDoneQ""E key and clicking it will simply close the OSK with no further action taken (this is exactly what I need) 2) On my HTC Magic (G2), also running 1.5 (of course): The OSK will have an enter key (showing the enter symbol instead of Q""EDoneQ""E) and when clicking it, the OSK will close and bring up the context menu of the text view. That is probably the last thing any user or developer would expect it to do. There seems to be no way to simply close the OSK after entering some text on the G2, *except* when specifying flagNoEnterAction in imeOptions, which on the G2 does what Q""EnormalQ""E does on the G1, but on the G1, this will lead to the OSK to not respond at all to the enter key (user has to hit Q""EbackQ""E to close the OSK). Further observations: It seems as if on the HTC Magic, the constant values backing the different IME options are shifted to the right by one (so to speak). That is, if you look at the different options as described in the API docs, then for example setting actionSearch on the text view will do exactly that on a G1, but will result in actionNext on the G2. Similarly, setting actionSearch will result in actionSend on the Magic being activated."

I have had the Comcast account for a long time and have used it on Nokia phones, Blackberries, HTC phones and the iPhone with absolutely no issues. The phone downloads messages from the Comcast server and sends messages. The issue is best described through an example. The Droid retrieves 25 messages from Comcast. I then go through the list, delete 20 and keep 5 in the inbox. At some point the messages I kept in the inbox randomly disappear from the inbox. Typically they donQ'Et all disappear at once. I think, but I am not sure, that the messages disappear when the Droid is loading messages from Comcast.

Android build number: Q""Edream_devphone-userdebug 1.6 DRC83 14721 test-keysQ""E (obtained via HTC). The issue did not exist within Android 1.5. Symptom is this: any application making use of the GPS (e.g., Google Maps, GPS Status) destroys the data connection: as soon as the GPS icon appears in the status bar, the data connection icon (whether 3G or Edge) disappears, even though phone reception is good. Mobile network state is listed as Q""EdisconnectedQ""E in the various status menus, and the phone does not appear to attempt to re-establish it, even after a long time; of course, all applications then lose Internet connectivity, including the one which caused the problem (e.g., Google Maps). Changing the APN and back again is sufficient to force the phone to re-establish a data connection. Voice service is unaffected. Both 2G (Edge) and 3G data connections are affected: limiting the phone to 2G network does not change anything. However, Wifi connections are unaffected by the problem. On the trigger side, itQ'Es really the use of GPS: using wireless networks to provide location does not cause the problem being described. Finally, the problem is not reproducible in the sense that the issue is not always present: it is absent immediately after boot and is triggered by circumstances which I havenQ'Et been able to elucidate. However, once it starts happening, it is 100% reproducible until the phone is rebooted (every use of the GPS will destroy the data connection, systematically, and if one forces a reconnection by changing the APN and back, a new attempt to use the GPS will re-destroy the connection). Rebooting the phone when the problem manifests itself is the best work-around I found so far. I will try to provide a log trace when possible."

But if I manually use the Matrix to convert the values and then call the rendering calls it works fine. 1. I have verified that this problem is in both Cupcake and Donut (emulator and HTC G1) 2. Create a custom view 3. Override onDraw 4. Create an onDraw like below. 5. The scaling factor 2.4414E-4f will make the canvas NOT use the matrix appropriately while 2.44141E-4 will make everything turn out fine. @Override protected void onDraw(final Canvas canvas) { super.onDraw(canvas); final DisplayMetrics metrics = getContext().getApplicationContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics(); final float scaleFactor = 2.4414E-4f; // 2.44141E-4f will render properly final float genUnits = metrics.xdpi / scaleFactor; final float sx = scaleFactor; final float sy = scaleFactor; final float left = 0.5f * genUnits; final float top = 0.5f * genUnits; final float right = left + genUnits; final float bottom = top + genUnits; final RectF rectF = new RectF(left, top, right, bottom); final Paint paint = new Paint(); paint.setAntiAlias(true); paint.setColor(android.graphics.Color.BLUE); paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL); canvas.save(); canvas.scale(sx, sy); canvas.drawRect(rectF, paint); canvas.restore(); } If you replace the last four lines of code with the following code which uses the matrix to scale the coordinates manually, then you will see that the object renders regardless of what scaling factor you are using in the Matrix. canvas.save(); final Matrix mtx = new Matrix(); mtx.preScale(sx, sy); mtx.mapRect(rectF); canvas.drawRect(rectF, paint); canvas.restore(); This implies that there is an issue with the Canvas Matrix transformation code. Not sure if there is some kind of error being thrown in the internals or what, but the small difference in that scale factor makes rendering to the canvas stop working properly. This is a pretty big issue since now if you want to use those kind of scaling factors you have to scale all of your points manually instead of just letting the Canvas handle it appropriately, which means either wrapping all of the Canvas APIs or spreading coordinate conversion code throughout. The expected behavior is that the Matrix that is on the Canvas should always scale the coordinates appropriately regardless of the scaling factor. Unless of course there is an underflow and then an error or exception should occur. Keith"

Software VN 1.0.0.A6288 and I am having a LOT of trouble using IMAP to access gmail accounts. (There are other similar issues on this site, I am raising this one to try and be very specific about what I think is a very severe and widespread failing in the email client, interfacing with gmail, so this is NOT a server-side problem) I am connecting to a gmail account, using IMAP. Problems are 1) the android client does not have the same understanding of IMAP as GMAIL does. As soon as the account is set up superfluous labels appear in gmail [IMAP]/Drafts [IMAP]/Sent [IMAP]/Trash No other IMAP client that I use (and I use many) needs to create labels/folders like this. 2) every email I send from the HTC HEro is duplicated in gmail. Once with no label, once with the IMAP/Sent label (I am speculating that one is created when the message is sent via SMTP, and then the Hero syncs another copy using IMAP) 3) changes made to messages on the web (read/archive) do not necessarily sync to the mobile. I am really fed up. - the gmail app on the HTC Hero is lovely, but only supports one gmail account (boo. the gmail app on my old Sony Ericcson was better, I canQ'Et beleive that moving to androd has worsened my email functijons) - the email on the HTC does not support IMAP properly - K9 works better - but that has itQ'Es own bugs as well Please help!"

I did not found this bug using 1.5 version of android, so I think is is a problem of donut version (maybe the spanish 1.6 version, I do not know if each mobile company provides its own modified version).

If the sender is not in my contacts but their number is given as part of the SMS message the threading works fine. However, if the sender ID is an non-numeric string rather than just a phone number the threading does not work. I get status notification updates from automated systems which use a textual identifier. Despite the sender string being the same all the messages appear as individual threads. This is very annoying if I have had lots or reports since I have to delete each one individually. To replicate this send yourself several messages via a provider like intellisoftware.co.uk with the sender set as Q'ETestQ'E."

The symptom varies depending on the client: the browser pops a dialog box that lets you proceed, but neither the distroQ'Es e-mail client nor K-9 can connect either sending or receiving. Jabiru has a similar problem. The cure is to put the root certificate, typically for your company net, into the certificate store. A procedure is described here: http:// www.math.ucla.edu/~jimc/g1-htc/x509-root.shtml This procedure can only be performed by an experienced sysadmin, not an end user. The real cure is for Android to include an app which (after lecturing the user about trust issues) can insert/replace/delete root certificates in the keystore. It should announce an association with the mime-type(s) of certificates, so the user can use the browser to obtain the root certificate (we hope on a secure internal LAN, not the global internet). The keystore is presently in /system/etc/security/cacerts.bks, and it will have to be moved to a read-write partition: /data/something/ cacerts.bks.

2727,keyboard,"Thu, 21 May 2009 07:47:04 +0000",On-screen keyboard performance problems (and general performance),"IQ'Em running 1.5 (Cupcake) on an HTC Magic. IQ'Eve had the phone for around 10 days. There appears to be a critical problem with the process-management in Cupcake which makes using the on-screen keyboard incredibly frustrating. I find that after IQ'Eve used several apps throughout the day, the device slows down to a crawl, often to the point where I cannot type on the on-screen keyboard. Pressing a key results in a 2-3s delay before the next keyboard press is registered. Often the extended character menu pops up (as if IQ'Eve press-held a key) and has to be dismissed. IQ'Eve found the only way to mitigate this problem is to soft-reset the device. It then behaves beautifully again, for the next 4-6 hours, gradually slowing down before getting frustrating again. I usually run the following apps throughout the day: 1. Native Gmail app 2. K9 email application (because the native one is so poor) 3. Greed RSS reader 4. Browser I also have Locale and Power manager running in the background, but experienced these problems before I installed them. The browser appears to cause the biggest problem. I have 2 gmail accounts that I use, so I access one through my registered handset account (the one used to post this bug) and the other I read via www.gmail.com. This really affects the phone badly, so I often navigate to a simpler page (e.g., GoogleQ'Es home page) once IQ'Em done as it seems to Q'Eweigh downQ'E the browser less. By the end of the day it takes 5-10 to display the home page when I return from the browser (this is instantaneous straight after a soft-reset) and I get aHome force-close warnings regularly. IQ'Em surprised more people arenQ'Et reporting the issue. To see it happen you just need to use the device for 6-12 hours, doing a mixture of email and browsing throughout the day. The problem is bad enough that if I wasnQ'Et more persistant (and wasnQ'Et a software developer myself so reasonably understanding about this sort of stuff) IQ'Ed have returned the device and bought an iPhone instead. :-\"

Im looking at two appointments today where i need to call them and get their addresses again because they are gone!

I would think this is something that google would want to fix quickly now that Maps supports navigation. I am using a rooted G1 (HTC Dream) running cyanogenmod 4.2.8 (i reported the bug there first but they said it was a google problem) Also, this is not Q'EUser errorQ'E. I am being extremely sure that i am entering the address and then checking and rechecking the event to be sure the address is there. The Where field goes blank later.

Note: I have experience this same problem when developing 2 completely different widgets, on two completely different devices. (HTC Hero on latest update and ADP1 on 1.6) The widgets start behaving strangely, as in outputting logs to logcat while the lines that outputted that log had been commented out, or not behaving as the code dictates they should. (It smells of caching issues, or reinstall bugs) 1. On one occasion, it was a project which actually installed many simple widgets, each of them was just an image which reproduced a sound when touched. First there were only 6 such widgets, but once I added another 10 more, some images were playing the incorrect sound files (although the code was correct). I can confirm that this was NOT a bug in my application, since a reboot solved this, and has also solved the issue on other users who had upgraded from the previous version just by rebooting (and it had worked fine during the first version). In case it helps, the widgets that were playing the wrong sound files happened to be the ones I had not removed from the desktop before installing the new version. 2. On the other occasion, it happened with another completely different widget, and this time i had removed all instances of the widget before reinstalling it. It started playing logs which were not present (commented out) in the source code. It also got resolved when rebooting."

9765,alarm,"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 02:28:56 +0000",(1) airplane mode on/off problem and (2) alarm cannot be stopped if it triggers when the phone is asking the PIN code,"These are in fact two connected issues that I have experienced with an HTC Legend running Android 2.1. The first issue can be simply described, but I cannot help on how to reproduce it. The phone goes spontaneously to airplane mode overnight on and then off. When that happens, if the alarm clock is set to some hour in the morning, when it starts to sound the phone finds itself asking for the PIN code. Then the second issue appears: in that state, dragging the bar down does not stop the alarm sound, but only brings to the PIN screen. In fact, in this case there is no snooze button, neither the side bar can be used to activate snooze mode. In this situation, the only reasonable thing to do (if awake enough!) is to introduce the PIN code (what brings to home screen, so there is no bar to drag to stop the alarm) and then force a reboot (no possiblity to snooze, of course, or else one risks getting up late). To avoid this problem, at the moment, a compromise solution is to deactivate the requirement of the PIN code to use the phone. Although the second issue typically appears because of the first one, it seems to me that its origin can be tracked down to the (old) design decision of using the PIN code as a general (smart)phone password, although its purpose is securing access to mobile communications. In other words, a smartphone is a PDA with mobile communications: why blocking all the PDA functions with the mobile password? This second issue can be easily reproduced by programming the alarm clock in, say, 3 minutes and then switching on, then off, airplane mode. When asked the PIN code, just let the screen go off (or manually force it off using the power button)."

I confirmed this problem exists on the following hardware/software: - HTC incredible OTA leak of Froyo+sense (7/13) - HTC incredible OTA leak of Froyo+sense (8/1) - HTC incredible Cyanogen mod 6 RC3 - Google Nexus 1 with Froyo I noticed this problem with Cherry rplayer from the marketplace, but other app that use a notification icon in the notification area (at the top of the screen) also demonstrate this problem. In summary, the problem is any app with a notification icon of some kind that is killed with something like Task Manager or Advanced Task Killer, etc leaves its notification icon behind. This is true even after using the return key in an app and telling it to always remove the icon when exiting. Steps to reproduce: 1. install cherry rplayer from marketplace (or any other app that has a notification icon it uses while itQ'Es running) 2. run said app and note the notification icon 3. use any task manager/killer app you like to kill that app specifically or all app not in a whitelist (which should include cherry rplayer or the app youQ'Ere using to test) 4. note the app DOES get killed properly (itQ'Es easiest with cherry rplayer with a stream running, since the stream aborts) 5. however, also note that the notification icon for the app remains. If more than one event is in the notification area, you can drag it down and hit clear to remove it, but often if itQ'Es the only one there, there is no way to get rid of it except to open the app again, then use the return button to exit it (with the setting to remove the icon enabled of course). As I said, I thought this was just a bug in the sense version of froyo, but I also tried the cyanogen mod and my friend with the stock froyo firmware for his nexus 1 is also able to reproduce this. Is this something that these app are going to need to update their code to explicitly handle? E.g. SIGINT handler to remove any notification stuff before exiting? Did something change in the way this works between 2.1 and 2.2 to cause these Q""EzombieQ""E notification icons? My expectation is that anything related to the process goes away when it is killed. I doubt these app are using kill -9 and whatever their shutdown sequence/exit handlers did before in 2.1 worked fine. ItQ'Es just something in 2.2. thatQ'Es preventing the status icon from being cleaned up when the app exits."

My application is designed to allow users to use the camera in a portrait orientation, so setting to landscape will not work for me.

I am constantly having a wifi issue described below: - I NEVER have any problems connecting to a wifi network; - Once I connect, the N1 wifi connection works for a random small amount of time (usually less than 2 minutes) and then stalls completely (no data is transfered, all app fail when trying to connect/download). - Once the connection is stalled, other kinds of problems start to occur. It seems like the wifi hardware stops responding for some reason. If I try to access the wifi settings, sometimes it does not respond and asks if I want to Force Close it. When it responds, if I try to turn wifi off, it will turn gray for some time, and then say Q""EUnable to stop wifiQ""E. If I try to turn wifi off from the power widget, the green indicator remains Q""Egrayed greenQ""E, the intermediate state between on and off. - Another symptom that the problem is that the hardware stopped responding, is that if I try to turn Bluetooth on, it will also fail (the N1 has a single broadcom chip that has both wifi and bluetooth). - When the connection is stalled, and the screen locks, it gets unsreponsive (touching the security bubbles does not show which bubble iQ'Em touching). It responds after 5+ seconds Router/connection information: I was travelling when I bought the phone so I had the oportunity to test on many different hotspots with different models/channels/encryption types. I could ALWAYS connect and use the connection for a little while, but on every single hotspot, after a period of 5s - 2 min, the connection was stalled. At home, I have a Netgear WGR614v9. I tested lots of different configurations including changing channels, no encryption, WEP, WPA, WPA2, disabling WME/WMM on the router, setting a static IP for the N1 (both on router and the N1). I have searched the web for similar problems/solutions, and found some people with the same problem on other android devices also, with different wifi hardware, such as the Motorola Droid, which suggests the problem might actually be on Android instead of the wifi driver. I can test/provide logs if needed. Just to reinforce: this is a data transfer issue, I can always scan, establish a connection, and obtain an IP address. Is Google/HTC aware of this problem? If so, will there be an update to correct this? What else can I try? My next guess would be trying to manually disable WMM on the phone (but I would have to root my phone to do that, and IQ'Em trying everything else first) Hardware information: Device: Nexus One Firmware: 2.1-update1 Version: ERE27 Router: Netgear WGR614v9 (latest firmware) Related Issue: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6269"

Instead of recording from the headset, it sometimes records from the phoneQ'Es built-in microphone. Steps to reproduce the problem: 1. Unplug the headset and go to the home screen 2. Adjust the phone volume, you need to make a change 3. Monitor via adb logcat | grep Q""ERouting audioQ""E 4. Insert a headset, i.e. headphones with microphone 5.

This behaves just like other Android phones. Here is the bug - when you use AudioRecord to record audio, the routing does not properly update. For example, perform these steps while monitoring the log as described above: 1. Unplug the headset and start at the home screen 2. Change the phone volume 3. Plug in the headset 4. Start an app that records audio, such as Q""EVoice RecorderQ""E or your own app that uses AudioRecord directly 5. Note that audio records from the phoneQ'Es microphone instead of the headset 6.

10675,GPS,"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 09:27:24 +0000",GPS position keeps falling back to the same wrong position 1 km off,"My location in Google Maps and Latitude always keeps falling back to the same wrong position approx. 1 km west-southwest from my home when IQ'Em at home and the GPS has no satellite reception. Most of the time when IQ'Em at home and in the house, Latitude also publishes that wrong position. This position is also shown after powering up the phone, until it gets a GPS position fix. I think it should instead show my most recent GPS position. The defect does not show when I am at work. It happens only and always when IQ'Em at home. I believe to remember that the defect was already there in my recent previous phone, a HTC Magic, so it is probably not a hardware defect. If I could offer a guess at where the problem lies, I would say that some program code falsely remembers that position from a time long past and does not properly age and forget that position. It looks like a faulty FIFO queue that fails to push out the oldest data element."
8085,calendar,"Sat, 01 May 2010 22:16:26 +0000",Google Calendar not syncing correctly with android - missing events out and overlapping events,Created my continental shift pattern today on google calendar which is a 3 shifts on and 3 shifts off alternating days and nights. The pattern repeats itself every 12 weeks so i created the events in Google calendar to repeat every 12 weeks. This appears correctly in google calendar but when i synced my HTC desire android in the android calendar it missed odd days off every now and again for no apparent reason and even created the odd day with a day and night shift together even though google calendar doesnQ'Et. Can you look in to this for me please.

13407,audio system,"Fri, 24 Dec 2010 23:16:41 +0000",mp3 playback: OS crashed,"IQ'Eve recently run into a serious mp3-bug. Listening to an mp3 my phone (htc Hero) crashed badly. The first time this happened, I heard a sound in my headphones, as if there was a minor short circuit. Looking at my phone, the screen was half-dimmed, showing the std search input bar (which I had not called up at all) and showing a list with only 1 item: a video file, not at all an audio file (which IQ'Ed expect). I had to pull the battery and thus reboot the phone. I repeated the process, playing the same mp3 using the same player, same crash at same point in playtime. Later I played the same file from a point in playtime about half a minute further then the point at which it crashed, and it played fine till the end. Could reproduce using the same mp3 as well as 2 difrerent ones (at different times) using 2 different programs (MixZing and Carcast) I used the free (fairly recent) versions of both. With Carcast, I downloaded a number of podcasts, this problem occurred early on during the Q""E qq-2010-11-27_02a milli amp makes you math mindedQ""E podcast. (http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/quirks_20101127_41805.mp3 64kbps, 527 seconds);the mp3 with the other player which crashed at the 5:29 mark, was 128kbps, 1676 seconds; this file played fine in Winamp on a laptop) Oddly enough, performing a similar test, using the std music app (first moving the slider to approx. 4:00, then playing the file, it merrily played on till beyond the 5:29 mark, where I thought MixZing crashed the OS, and since I believe MixZing uses the system apiQ'Es to play the syandard files, and presumably, Carcast does too, I chose to report this bug anyway. IQ'Em using: firmware 2.1 update 1 softwarenumber 3.32.405.2 Kernel:2.6.29-063c4d24 htckernel @and18-2#1 This is the latest update level: IQ'Eve checked and there are no available updates, phone is uptodate (checking using wifi from the phoneQ'Es system panel. So there are 2 issues: 1) solve the bug using mp3 playback 2)fix the crashing error, even if these 2 programs use 3rd party libraries to render mp3s, the OS shouldnQ'Et crash on a bug. Only the program itself may crash."

7580,time,"Wed, 07 Apr 2010 03:12:39 +0000",Android should _never_ ask for the timezone (but it does all the time),"Background: I have noticed the same problem on a stock 1.5 ROM, custom 1.5 ROMs and on custom 2.1 ROMs on my HTC Hero. Problem: When the GSM signal drops out (I go out of range or into an area with poor coverage) Android often asks me to set the timezone. It presents me with a notification which leads to a dialogue, and in the dialogue the default option is always the current timezone, so I always just press done. This is terribly annoying and totally unnecessary. Here is how Android should figure out which timezone to use, in order, until a timezone is found: 1. Directly from the mobile network 2. Find the location using the mobile network and do a lookup to figure out which timezone it must be 3. Use the GPS to find the location then do a lookup to figure out which timezone it must be 4. Use the currently set timezone 5. Ask the user to set the timezone This process should get to step 5 at _most_ once. Once I have set the timezone once it should either update to a new timezone if it figures out via steps 1-3 that IQ'Eve moved somewhere or it should keep the existing timezone and leave me alone. Android could have some user-configurable options to change the behaviour of changing timezones, for example you could disable any or all of steps 1-3, and you could have an option to always ask the user before changing timezone. It would be excellent if I never have to be alerted that my phone doesnQ'Et what timezone itQ'Es in even when it has the hardware to figure out where I am and the chances that IQ'Eve actually travelled somewhere are so unlikely."

6174,signal,"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 09:00:46 +0000",Support for GSM Alternate Line Service (ALS / Line 2),"The ALS allows a GSM SIM to have two phone numbers registered to it and for the phone to take calls from both lines and for the user to select which line to use for outgoing calls. It is part of the CHPS (Common PCN Handset Specification) specification some of which already appears to be in the package com.android.internal.telephony.gsm (mCphsInfo) ALS is currently supported by Orange in the UK (as the Line 2 service). Many existing mobile handsets from Nokia, Palm and HTC windows devices support line 2 and notify the user which line an incoming call is being received on and allow the user to select (either by menu or keyboard shortcut) the line to use for outgoing calls. Line 2 is not implemented in Android 1.5. Android does not provide any means of changing the line in use (although if the line in use is changed by inserting the SIM into a phone that does support ALS than Android will respect that). Incoming calls on the second line appear to ring but there is no notification on the phone of the incoming call. Support for ALS would increase the value of Android phones. Basic support for ALS plus APIs for developers to extend functions would be very helpful (I am not a developer, just a user of Line 2)"

9404,browser,"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 18:47:40 +0000",WebKit/browser leaking SQL storage space,"Device: HTC EVO 4G on Sprint. Android 2.1. WeQ'Eve been working with web applications that use the offline application cache and the SQL storage API. We began to encounter the following error while in the browser: Internet storage full. This error appear in the notifications, and the SQL storage and caching API doesnQ'Et work until space is freed up. When we first encountered this, we started logging memory usage by way of the Settings - Applications - Manage applications - Internet We initially found that Internet was using Total: 44.48 MB Data: 43.06 MB Cache: 1.42 MB We would empty the cache and stop the application and resume testing. We soon discovered that the amount of memory consumed by the Internet/webkit app is rising, and no clearing of the cache or reset of the browser will recover it. Presently, the device says Total: 55.02 MB Data: 55.02 MB Cache: 0 KB The interesting thing about this space leakage is that it reduces the size of the database we can allocate using the Javascript window.openDatabase statement. Whereas we initially could allocate a database with a maximum size of 5000000 bytes (5MB), we can now only allocate databases less than a fifth of this amount (500KB works, 1MB doesnQ'Et). Summary: To replicate the problem: 1) Clear browser cache and storage. 2) Check storage use by the Internet application in Settings - Applications - Manage applications 3) Visit HTML5 app that use both the SQL storage API and the offline application cache. 4) Repeat step 2 to see changes in storage use. 5) Clear the cache and reset the browser. 6) Repeat step 2. Browser storage use should be the same as in step 2. What should happen: Clearing cache and Internet storage (in Internet, Menu - Settings - Reset to default (+Clear Cache)) should free up total Internet storage OR AT LEAST Allow SQL storage applications access to the full 5MB per application. Other note: Our application has been using the same database version number in the Javascript openDatabase command, i.e., Q'E0.2Q'E We applied HTC update 1.47.651.1, but this made no difference (or possibly made it worse)."

Silent (Silent mode is currently turned OFF) Airplane Mode (Airplane mode is currently OFF) [...] The point is: if everything is in Q""Enormal modeQ""E, the defaults are ON (Sound) and OFF (Airplane Mode) which puzzles the user. Second, Q""ESilentQ""E and Q""ESound is ONQ""E is some kind of opposite. Every time I want to check my state or modify the settings, I really have to read the whole text carefully and think, if sound is on or silent mode is on. The user usually checks the heading (currently: Q""ESilentQ""E) and the value below (currently: Q""EONQ""E). This situation can be misinterpreted for Q""ESilent mode is ONQ""E. But in fact the opposite is the case: Q""ESound is ON, Silent is OFFQ""E. So rephrasing the text can significantly increase usability of this dialog. Even better: additionally to rephrasing the text, you should highlight every entry that is activated (which means it differs from Q""Enormal settingsQ""E). So if I press Q""ESilent mode ONQ""E, the entry should get e.g. a different background color. In that case, I even do not have to *read* the small text! I immediately recognize the highlighted entry around the word Q""ESilentQ""E as being activated (e.g. different from default setting). Way better usability!

Performance is restored when I turn on background data. I have tried all sorts of versions - Pure AOSP, CM6 Mods, Epic stock...I can reproduce same results. I have tried this on clean (without any other downloaded app) ROM as well. I have generated logcat as attached and it seems that calendar part of AOSP email is generating alarms.

The SIM card is provided by the same company as the Exchange server and has been successfully used on a HTC Windows Mobile phone previously.

This issue is discussed in detail over here: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/exchange2010/thread/bcc50ce4-0c97-4851-987d-1f5080d7942b The logs are also pasted there in several posts from different customers. Basically, you see: Q""EError:DeviceNotProvisioned_As:BlockedP_Mbx:Q""E in IIS Logs, which is error code 449. It means that when the new Android based device connected to the server to sync with a particular mailbox, the server told the device that there are some specific security policies in effect on the server and they are being applied on the userQ'Es mailbox as well to which the device wants to sync with, thus the device has to acknowledge to that and reply affirmatively that it does support the EAS security policies, before server will let it sync with the mailbox. The device never responds to the Q'EProvisionQ'E command from server (related to provisioning process) and thus gets blocked. This is being reported by most new device owners made by Motorola and HTC and they have a 2.1 build of Android. There is no confirmation that this issue is resolved in Android 2.2 except for some anecdotal evidence from customers/users of such devices (with Froyo update). Can someone at Google or Android Project provide a current status of this issue and steps to resolve this issue for Android 2.1 users?

11236,network setting,"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 22:10:41 +0000",DHCP client ignores lease time,"Princeton University is seeing problems with the DHCP client behavior from many Android devices on Princeton UniversityQ'Es wireless networks. The devices are often ignoring DHCP lease times, continuing to use leased IP addresses after allowing the leases to expire. Sometimes the client also tries to renew the lease after the lease expires, which doesnQ'Et make sense. Sometimes the client continues using an IP address from an old expired lease at the same time it uses an IP address from a newly-acquired DHCP lease. -- PLATFORMS: Our customer support organization has begun collecting from owners of the malfunctioning devices the following information: Android version, device make and model. We have only just begun to receive this data, so it does not yet reflect the full range of platforms experiencing the problem. Here is what we have to-date: MAKE/MODEL ANDROID VERSION HTC Droid Incredible 2.2 Samsung Captivate 2.1 Samsung Captivate 2.1-update1 Google Nexus One something older than 2.2 I will update this bug report when I have more platform information. I saw this malfunction from one Android device in February 2010, another in April, another in June, nine in July, ten in August. During September 1-11, I saw 24 more Android devices exhibit the problem. Since then, the number has continued to grow. Many of the devices exhibit the problem repeatedly. I donQ'Et know if this pattern simply reflects the rapid growth in Android use, or indicates that the bug was only introduced to Android in a recent OS update, now reaching more devices. -- BEHAVIOR: The Android client connects to our 802.11 wireless network. It uses DHCP to obtain a lease. Our leases for wireless clients are typically 3 hours or 1 hour long (renewal at 50%, rebind at 85%). IQ'Eve also verified the problem using a 10-minute lease. The device renews its DHCP lease zero or more times. Eventually, the device stops renewing its DHCP lease. It remains attached to the wireless network. It may roam from one AP to another (within the same ESSID), but doesnQ'Et actually disconnect entirely (it remains within the coverage area). The DHCP lease expires. It still remains attached to the wireless network. It may roam from one AP to another (within the same ESSID), but doesnQ'Et actually disconnect entirely (it remains within the coverage area). -- Issue 1: The device continues using the IP address. That is, it continues to respond to ARP Requests, claiming to own that IP address. It responds to ICMP Echo Request for that IP address. It responds to UDP and TCP traffic sent to that IP address. It initiates traffic to the Internet from that IP address. It may do so for hours after the lease has expired. This issue is common to all the Android devices exibibiting the bug. Eventually the device uses DHCP (in the INIT or INIT-REBOOT state) to request a new lease, which usually ends the incident. One situation that appears to trigger this is that the device disconnects from the wireless network (or loses it connection), for example, as a result of leaving the ESSIDQ'Es coverage area; when it next connects, it starts in the DHCP INIT state. I imagine there are other circumstances that also will trigger a return to the DHCP INIT state. -- Issue 2: Sometimes the malfunctioning device exhibits this issue in addition to issue #1. While the device is continuing to use the IP address after the lease has expired, sometimes it unicasts DHCPREQUEST packets to the DHCP server for that lease, asking to renew the lease. It may do this for a few minutes, or for hours. That makes no sense, as the lease has already expired. (A DHCP client wishing to renew a lease must renew it before the lease expires, not afterwards.) (Our DHCP server refuses to renew the lease if the IP address was for a dynamically- assigned IP address; the lease has already expired.) A check of one affected client confirms that the problem is *not* due to the clientQ'Es clock going backwards in time since it obtained the lease. The clock on the client seems to be counting forwards just fine. -- Issue 3: Sometimes the malfunctioning device exhibits this issue in addition to issue #1. As described above, eventually the device chooses to return to the DHCP INIT or INIT-REBOOT state. (I do not know what triggers this.) It asks for a new lease, and obtains one. Sometimes this new lease is for a different IP address than the old lease. The device begins using the IP address from the new lease. This is normal. But sometimes, the device continues using the IP address from the old expired lease as well. That is, the device is now using both IP addresses simultaneously. (It answers IP ARP Request packets for both IP addresses.) Over time, the device may use DHCP to obtain a series of leases, but it continues to also use the IP address from that earlier expired lease as well. -- Sometimes, the malfunctioning device exhibits issues #1, #2, and #3 simultaneously. For example, the original lease on IP address Q'EaQ'E expires, and the device continues using that IP address after lease expiration. Later, the device enters DHCP INIT and obtains a lease on IP address Q'EbQ'E. The device now uses both IP addresses Q'EaQ'E and Q'EbQ'E simultaneously. While doing so, the device also tries to renew the expired lease on IP address Q'EaQ'E. STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE BEHAVIOR: On an HTC Droid Incredible running Android 2.2, I am able to reproduce the issue easily. (In fact, itQ'Es rare that the DHCP client operates properly.) I unlock the device, connect to Wi-Fi, wait for it to obtain a lease via its Wi-Fi interface. I then allow the device to lock its screen. I am performing wireless packet capture using another device. I am also observing the logs from the DHCP servers, and the logs from the wireless access points (showing client connections and disconnections). This lets me see that the DHCP lease expires, and the device is not trying to use DHCP to renew the lease or obtain a fresh lease. With the device still locked, I can see it will continue to respond to (unicast) ARP Request packets, ICMP Echo Request packets, unicast UDP packets, and TCP packets. If I press the POWER button to wake the device, and then do not swipe the soft control to unlock the device (instead allowing it to go back to sleep), I see no DHCP activity. The device continues to use the IP address even though the lease has expired. The same is true if I press the POWER button to wake the device and then DO swipe the soft control to unlock the device. The same is true if an incoming SMS message causes the device to perform notification (sound an alert, post a notification, pop up a message on the screen, and light up the screen) which I choose to ignore, allowing the screen to go back to sleep. If I wake the device and actually start using the web browser, I see it also exhibits issue #2: it unicast a DHCPREQUEST to try to renew the lease that has expired. IQ'Em not yet sure how to reliably reproduce issue #3. --- I have also been able to reproduce the problem when the device is awake during the time it should have renewed its lease. For example, if I awake the device before time T1 (renewal time), and keep the device awake past lease expiration time, the device does not attempt to renew its lease. The lease expires, and the device keeps using the IP address. (The only thing I need to do to reproduce the problem is to ensure the device remains in the Wi-Fi coverage area, so it doesnQ'Et experience a disconnect.) So it would be incorrect to characterize this as a Q""Edevice fails to renew lease when it is asleepQ""E problem. --- Irwin Tillmans Network Systems, Office of Information Technology, Princeton University"

I plugged the supplied DC charger into 12v(neg-gnd) cigarette lighter socket and car dock. After driving somewhere for approximately 30 mins., the supplied battery gets way too hot. Running app like G-maps has no effect on this issue. This occurs each time I use the supplied cigarette lighter with or without the car dock. I discovered that my car has a 10amp ATO blade fuse installed which supplies power for the cigarette lighter and stereo receiver. This is consistent with the MFG. specifications for my vehicle and is typical of most vehicles IQ'Eve owned(pre-2000). I reviewed the specs for the desktop charger which states the current rating to be at 2amps. So, I lowered the fuse rating in my car to 3amps. This successfully mitigated the overheating that occurs. However, In reality one canQ'Et arbitrarily lower the fuse in their car because it is meant to support multiple electrical systems (such as the radio, cig-lighter, dome light etc.).

11061,UI browser,"Tue, 07 Sep 2010 04:35:37 +0000",JavaScript onScroll and WebView onScrollChanged work in emulator but not on real devices,"I am trying to write a specialized browser application. The application uses a WebView to load a page from the website that itQ'Es intended to view (reading a book online in this case). The app needs to have JavaScript that can respond to scrolling events on the page so that it can report back to the Android application what portions of the book chapter are visible on the page (and thus they can be marked as read). I have this all working great in multiple emulators. But, when I installed the app on my Evo today, the document.onscroll function is never fired. So, I tried overriding WebView#onScrollChanged(int, int, int, int) and calling loadUrl(Q""Ejavascript....Q""E) from there. Again, it worked on the emulator, but not on the Evo. I tried on my wifeQ'Es HTC Hero - again, it didnQ'Et work. Short summary: JS document.onscroll (as well as document.body.onscroll and window.onscroll) are not fired in a WebView on a real device. WebView#onScrollChanged(int, int, int, int) also seems not to be fired, or else it is unable to call loadUrl(String) with JS when it is fired on a real device. Both methods work find on an emulator. Expected behavior: The devices should work the same as the emulator. Preferably the JS onscroll event should work. IQ'Eve attached a simple application that is greatly stripped down from what I described above (the book reading application). This app simply loads a page in a WebView, injects some JS that fires a couple of example alerts (which are displayed as a toast in the app), and adds an event handling function to document.onscroll. The app works great in multiple emulators (IQ'Eve tried 1.5 and 2.2). The onscroll is never called on an HTC Hero or HTC Evo."

However, even after reboot, the search button does not launch the Google Search button, and there is no Search settings in the system Settings. By using adb logcat, I found this: W/SearchManager( 1502): No global search activity found. However, given that the Google Search has been (and is publicly capable of) being installed in /data/app/, it should be able to take over the Search button action. To date, the only method I have found of enabling the Search button again, is to copy /data/app/com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox-1.apk to /system/app/GoogleQuickSearchBox.apk and reboot. This has also been found true when leaving the original /system/app/GoogleQuickSearchBox.apk in place, and having the Market-installed version in /data/app still. What should happen: When installing a new launcher (ADW, LauncherPro, etc.), the Home button can be re-mapped to open the preferred launcher, as is also the case with long-pressing the Search button (normally for Voice Search). This ability to choose a default action for short-pressing the Search button should be added, to reflect the userQ'Es installation of a newer, updated version of Google Search, or a replacement product that may be created in the future.

I wonder if it is possible to add a setting where the default font can be changed? E.g. if I primarily write in Japanese and cannot speak any Chinese, a Japanese font is better suited for me. If I mainly use traditional Chinese, a Taiwanese font would be better. The same goes for Korean.

IQ'Eve been out of full time work since December 2008 so this should go to explain why I am so angry about this.

9518,upgrade,"Sun, 04 Jul 2010 16:00:44 +0000",Nexus stock N1 OTA to Froyo failed,"I am having dreadful problems with the update to 2.1 on my stock unmodified N1 from google direct. I have been battling with the update and having the most torrid time. I was running happily on ERE27 (i.e 2.1 Update 1) until Friday when I had the update offered to me when I went to the phone in the morning. I am in the UK with a stock N1 bought direct from google in the USA no rooting or messing with bootloader. I had the same symptoms as others have reported many times in various forum postings. I could not get the phone to boot up at all once the update had apparently unpacked and installed. I had to return to the dead phone after a dayQ'Es work without a phone on me. After doing a lot of reading and seeing if there were any files available for download I eventually came across various files from a number of sites - I tried downloading the update file: signed-passion-FRF91-from-ERE27.e410116a.zip on a laptop and then took out the micro sd card and copied the file to the card as update.zip as suggested on other postings, and then went through the rigmarole of trying to hold the trackball and power on, to get to the bootloader and then select recovery - it did not work. I ended up in the dreaded boot loop. After trying a number of other files I ened up with the Q""Eboot loopQ""E problem where the phone buzzes and shows the static coloured cross but then goes blank, buzzes and shows the coloured cross, repeating forever - so I thought that my phone was totally caput. More reading - eventually I found a site which had what appeared to be an original install file: PASSIMG_Passion_Google_WWE_1.01.1700.1_ERD79_relea se_signed.zip I took out the micro sd card again and in the laptop reformatted the card to FAT32, and then copied this file to the card as PASSIMG.zip After putting it back into the phone and holding the trackball whilst pressing power on, the phone boots to the booloader and it recognised the install image and proceeded to install the original stock ERD79 eclair. This worked fine and the phone booted up to a stock system. Then I took out the card, deleted the PASSIMG.zip file and tried the file: signed-passion-ERE27-from-ERD79.a487b405.zip named as update.zip on the card, and then selected the bootloader on bootup - this worked - and once the unpack and install had happened booting to the green droid and yellow exclamation mark happens then selecting power on then volume up allows the system to be restarted and the install completes - the phone will now boot to ERE27 (i.e. 2.1 update 1) just fine. So I then knew that the phone could be brought back into a stock system plus the update to ERE27. Each time the phone booted it would immediately attempt to download the OTA update. I selected not to install the OTA any more but sought to try manually updating to Froyo. From that point I tried various attempts with various files: signed-passion-FRF91-from-ERE27.e410116a.zip This failed and I ended up in the boot loop with no apparent way out but to go back and install the stock image from scratch again, and then the update to ERE27 I tried signed-passion-FRF50-from-ERE27.1e519a24.zip This failed in the same way. I also tried signed-passion-ota-43546.cc653ee4.zip and signed-passion-ota-42745.dc39ca1f.zip as well as signed-passion-FRF83-from-FRF50.38d66b26.zip All of these are various update files to go to Froyo and every time I ended up with the dreaded Q""Eboot loopQ""E and unable to to anything with the phone. Each time I had to re-install the stock ERD79 and then update to ERE27. I have now left my phone with ERE27 running perfectly happily but every half hour it tries to get me to run the install of the downloaded OTA file (about which I can find no information from within the phone itself, and the file does not appear to end up on the micro sd card, as I took the card out and looked at it when plugged into a laptop - no update file appears to be on it so I presume that the download file goes to main memory somewhere?) I would really really appreciate it if google would enter the discussion or provide an official document on the google help area or somewhere that people can go to fix their phones - as this is really very very frustrating for many. What we need is a step by step set of instructions that will help us get the phone working on Froyo. For information my phone now has: Firmware version 2.1-update1 Baseband version 32.24.00.22U_4.03.00.21_2 Kernel Version 2.6.29-01117-gbc62c2 android-build@apa26 #1 I donQ'Et know if specific other kernels may have been on different phones when they were receiving the OTA or if radio firmware is different on different phones running apparently the same versions as above and whether or not those version numbers could be relevant to this issue - either way google really ought to step into the fray here and come to our rescue! Maybe others who have had their phones work fine could quote what they were running when they had successful updates (if possible) and others might quote the detailed version numbers where they have not had successful updates - that way maybe we could find a pattern in where there have been problems? Another thought - one thing that would be extremely helpful would be if google would provide a single install file for FRF91 that will work from any phone - i.e. put the install file onto the top directory of the micro sd card, named as PASSIMG.zip and then hold the trackball, and power on to get to the bootloader - and then install a working Froyo system without having previous files that may be hindering the updates that people are trying to get to work. By the way it seemed to me that although 2.1 was working fine - every attempt to update my own Nexus from 2.1 to 2.2 by whichever route I tried always ended up with a phone that was stuck in the boot loop (also apparently known as the BLOD = Boot Loop of Death!) Every time I was able to return my phone to a working one with Eclair by installing ERD79 followed by the update to ERE27. Is there any chance that some phones had slightly different hardware (eg the radio chip) compared to others or were all phones manufactured with exactly the same chipsets?? It would be useful to have this information from anyone who might know - or from HTC or from Google. If we could find batches of phones all having the same problems and they have different chipsets than those with successful updates then maybe we could have a route to getting a fix? Also has anyone actually spoken direct to google engineers about the problem and had good advice on what to do to fix the problems? In addition to my info above the bootloader screen (with the three droids) comes up with the following at the top: HBOOT-0b15 TouchPanel-SYNT0103 RADIO-4.06.00.12_7 Dec 17 2009, 13:05:23 Maybe this would be worth comparing on phones that do and donQ'Et update correctly as another factor that may be important? Help appreciated..."

Now I have noticed that since the Q""Epreparing SD cardQ""E message *always* appears, there seems to be a task running in the background that attempts to check my SD card for errors and consumes huge amounts of CPU. This task makes my entire phone very unresponsive, at times I have to wait 30-45secs(!) just to enter the phone menu and place a call. An unpleasant side effect is that my phoneQ'Es battery now only lasts for half a day instead of the still meager 1-day-cycle. So the SD-card-check-task makes Android look very bad on my phone (CPU load + power drain), however I see this as a separate issue to bug 2500 since I have a problem with the SD card checker-task, which is independent of why the SD card seems corrupt to Android in the first place (which is what 2500 deals with)."

Clearly, the open source nature of this operating system is not viable in a commercial environment. Google need to recify this issue moving forward (if unable to find a way to do so retroactively) Is it technically feasible for Google to award a form of badge / moniker that hardware firms / operators can use to indicate that updates to the Android OS will be provided within an agreed timescale of the code stream being released? Is it technically feasible for hardware manufacturers to submit drivers / UI changes to Google to be awarded a badge / moniker which Google can then test on new updates to ensure changes to the Android system are backwards compatible with existing drivers / UI changes - allowing future updates to be managed by Google? This is a serious issue hampering the growth of Android - there are numerous HTC Magic (Q""EMyTouchQ""E) users in the UK that I know of who are becoming quite vociferous about this - nobody from the operator or the hardware manufacturer is willing to accept liability for updates to the software and it seems quite anti-commercial to these firms to invest time and effort into supporting old hardware when they have newer hardware due for release.

Android 1.6 switches all Appointments for one hour late when actual Timezone is Daylightsaving time (that is +1) . --WHAT I THINK THE CORRECT BEHAVIOUR SHOULD BE-- As every other PIM (and googlecalendar) does it: Entering the daylightsaving time does not change Appointment-Times for Appointments that were made Outside of Daylightsaving time. --ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS-- I kept playing around with this issue a lot for now. I coded some windows- tool that changes all outlook items to UTC, then I tried to code an app for android that changes all times. But that changed the times in my outlook and googlecalendar, too. and so on. The problem is obviously a bug inside the android-calendar-database, because as I mentioned: googlecalendar behaves differently. So this issue suerely has to be fixed inside android ! And it should be fixed quickly (hopefully with a patch- app) because this makes using android as a PIM a risky adventure. Oh, btw: Changing the timezone on the android-device itself doesnt work either because then either all outside-daylightsaving-time-events will be one hour early or (if you change them) all those contacts will be shown wrong in calendar/outlook.

I look at the inbox and the thread still shows only 39 messages. The web interface correctly shows 40 messages. Note: This message was sent over 5 hours ago.

However, when I click on the thread on the app, message 39 is shown and there is no longer a message 40.

The last mail in a thread (message 40) is not displayed in the gmail app on the phone. The message was sent over 5h ago, so it should not be because of the phone not syncing with the server. I have also gotten lots of other mails during the day that were displayed correctly within the gmail app. - What you think the correct behavior should be.

The telefone number transmitted for the call via BT could be something like Q""ENAVIGATIONQ""E (if text is allowed), so the hands-free in the car would display this text instead of a telephone number on the stereo/car display. Maybe you could even transmit the navigation instruction. When the instruction is over, the phone should simply end the Q""EemulatedQ""E phone call. The cool thing would be that the car stereo would automatically stop playing music/radio during the instruction. Interestingly, the whole thing works like that (partiall). In my car, there is no A2DP (FIAT BlueQ&EMe) so the phones loudspeakers read the nav instructions. If you are making a phone call at the time the navigation instruction is send, it is send through Bluetooth and mixed into the voice audio! So it generally works, but for the case of no phone call, it should emulate one. Ideally there should be a config option to change the mode in GMaps mobile: Hands-free, A2DP, always loudspeaker I am using a HTC Desire, Android 2.2. Thanks!"

11026,calling,"Sun, 05 Sep 2010 19:58:28 +0000",Diverted incoming call notification,"First I will explain it simple: I have an A number and a B number. B is my business number, A is personal. I carry only A number, and all calls that come to B number are automatically diverted to my A number, where I can see the number that is calling it. If someone is calling B number and it rings on my A phone, on Nokia, NEC and LG phones there is a small sign like Q""EQ>EQ""E that indicates that the phonecall was made to ma B number which is switched off in the office, so the network automatically diverts a call made to B number to my own A number. Then I can decide weither to answer my phone or not. HTC phones, Desire, Hero and Wildfire do not have this sign, so if a call is made to my A or B number there is no notification as to which number a call was made. I need that little sign, indicating that a call was diverted to my A phone from another number. If you understand what I need, you do not need to read anything furterh, and I thank you for reading. If you have an idea how I can resolve this issue without a call diverted indicator without actual indicator, like using my phonebook to sort out calls, please continue to read. There is also a C number, being my other number which I donQ'Et carry all the time just some times, so this number is also diverted to my A number. And on my job I carry B and A, but not C, but C is diverted to A also, so if B phone is on and A phone is on, C is off, C is diverted to A, and I need to know that a phonecall is made to C number, because I DO NOT WANT to answer that call in any way, I want to call that person back! And the reason for that is a hefty charge made to C number if I answer that phone, and it is triple or even 5 times cheaper to call that person back and not answer a phonecall made to C number. The issue with B number is simple, I have a free call from B number to A number, so Divert from B number is not charged, so I can answer it. When I get off work I power on the C number and power of B number and have with me A and C numbers so calls are only diverted from B number. Now you can see that I really really need the little diverted call indicator. Nokia NEC and LG phones have that. SonyEricsson has it but rather useless, because it only indicates for 3 seconds that a phonecall was diverted and continues ringing normal way. It would be great to have that indicator, and if maybe could be possible for a phone to ring with different tone when a call is diverted, that would also save me the trouble of looking to a phone when I drive, I would immediately know if the phonecall is diverted."

Here I am referring to the Folders present and created by the user on a Home-screen. This means that once I exit the last selected and currently running application and go back out I have to go through the extra step of first manually shutting whatever folder that I had open that the app icon was located in before I can go ahead and choose something else on that same Home-screen. Until I do this the Folder continues to stay open on that particular Home-screen, even if I navigate to another place and come back to it. Instead, I would prefer if the folder just shut and didnQ'Et remain open once an app selection has been made from it, so that when I exit/quit or leave that app (through the Q'EBACKQ'E button or say even the Q'EHOMEQ'E button, by which I mean the hardware hard buttons) for any reason, I am taken right back to that Home-screen with only the top-level icons visible.

In the event that the transform applied to the matrix is effectively nil, there is no change to the rendering (because the Q'EmOrigMatrix.equals(matrix)Q'E in the if statement above causes Q'EifQ'E clause to be run rather than the Q'EelseQ'E clause. I think the 1.5 scaling in mCompatibleMatrix and Surface.CompatibleCanvas.mOrigMatrix is used to map the image density to the EvoQ'Es display density. The else clause in setMatrix has the effect of causing the 1.5 scaling to be applied twice (yeilding a scaling of 1.5*1.5 == 2.25) because it is part of mCompatibleMatrix as well as mOrigMatrix. A minor change to the matrix (translation by 0 pixels as opposed to translate by 1 pixel) should not cause the dramatic change in the rendering. (It is also not appropriate to tell users to reset() the matrix to the unity transform before using it (as in: Matrix mat = canv.getMatrix(); mat.reset(); // Reset to unity transform mat.preTranslate(0, 1); // The transform the user wants canv.setMatrix(mat); ) In the off chance that the user happens to set his matrix to a transform that happens to match the mOrigMatrix (ie a preScale(1.5, 1.5) in my case) then the mOrigMatrix.equals(matrix) term in the if statement in setMatrix will think the user is doing no transform and will do the Q'EifQ'E clause rather than the Q'Eelse clause and produce an inconsistent result.

When I do ping to joynet on my laptop, it says it is pinging Q""Ejoynet.joensuu.fiQ""E [192.168.0.1]. If I do the same on Android phone, using Android Debug Bridge (adb), for Q""Eping joynetQ""E it says it cannot find the hostname. If I do Q""Eping joynet.joensuu.fiQ""E, it pings correctly on 192.168.0.1. And this brings the problem that since the joynet gateway HTTPS server only shows the login form when hostname Q""EjoynetQ""E is used in the HTTP headers, it makes it impossible to use WiFi on such networks because logging in is not possible. (going to https://joynet.joensuu.fi:443/login or https://192.168.0.1:443/login simply causes a redirection to https:// joynet:443/login) So my assumption here is that there is a bug that Android does not take into account the domain of the network it is connected to, and this causes local hostname lookups to fail."

The update added HTCQ'Es Sense UI and IQ'Em not sure if this applies to the UI or Android, but itQ'Es about the soft keyboard so IQ'Ell put it here. For lots of short words containing apostrophes (donQ'Et, canQ'Et, etc) the apostrophe is added automatically after I hit the space key, but for some words which are valid with or without an apostrophe (its/itQ'Es, etc) it will just leave the apostrophe out by default. This requires me to long-press a key to get an apostrophe or (before the update) switch to the special characters keyboard and select an apostrophe. This isnQ'Et a huge deal, but itQ'Es very annoying. IQ'Em proposing that, in the list of word suggestions, when there is a word that could have an apostrophe in it, that word be listed next to the default. For example, when I type Q""EitsQ""E right now, the word suggestions are Q""Eits, Its, itd and yrs.Q""E It would be nice if this became Q""Eits, itQ'Es, itd and yrs,Q""E to avoid doing the long-press."

Excatly how large should the postview be? It is Q""EscaledQ""E, but to what size? The cause: The callbacks are set from HAL implementation, so the erronously sized images may be hard to fix unless Qualcomm (in the case of Nexus One) gets involved. But at least it can be clearly stated what size is correct. It is probably a legacy from earlier Android versions where there was no Postview callback so Qualcomm decided to send it in the Raw Callback. The solution: 1. Clearly define Raw callback to be the same size as the picture size and the same format as picture format. 2. Clearly define the postview callback to be the same size as the preview size and the same format as preview format. 3. Make sure Qualcomm fix their implementation to comply with these specs.

This is really stupid and I donQ'Et understand the rationale behind it. I also want to be able to set reminders to remind me of something Q""EOn timeQ""E. The closest possible reminder now is 1 minute, which does not suite some of my needs. For example if I have an event that starts at 5:00 pm, I would sometimes like the reminder to appear at 5:00 pm and not 4:59 pm. And for an all-day event, I may want the reminder to appear exactly at 12:00 midnight and not 11:59 of previous day. The last thing I want is to migrate events from PC Sync to Google Calendar and vice versa. I hope Google will consider these problems and push a patch to all Android devices (not just update the upcoming version!)

11241,audio,"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 23:29:07 +0000",MediaPlayer prepare() has a Q>E 1 second prefetcher latency for http sources,"In Android Foyo / 2.2, when using a MediaPlayer instance to play audio data from an HTTP source, the prefetcher introduces a greater than 1 second delay not matter how fast the HTTP source is. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create an Android 2.2 test project 2. Create a media player instance 4. Set the data source to the URL shown above 5. Call setDataSource(some_http_url) 6. measure the current timestamp (before_prepare = System.nanoTime()) 7. call prepare() 8. measure the current timestamp (after_prepare = System.nanoTime()) 9. see that (after_prepare-before_prepare Q>E 1 second) In practice, on a physical device (HTC Desire running Froyo, build number 2.09.405.8), we see an average of 1.2 seconds for the prepare() time. This is a significant problem for applications that want to play audio from a local app-generated data source, by implementing a local HTTP server to serve the data (this is the only way to play compressed audio, mp3 or aac, that is not stored in a file or a remote HTTP server), since it introduces a Q>E 1 second delay every time a new song is selected. Looking at the source code of the media stack (libstagefright), it seems that there are two functions that are guilty for this bug: 1/ in media/libstagefright/Prefetcher.cpp, function void Prefetcher::threadFunc(), we find this loop: --------------------------------------- void Prefetcher::threadFunc() { bool fillingCache = false; for (;;) { spQ<EPrefetchedSourceQ>E minSource; int64_t minCacheDurationUs = -1; { Mutex::Autolock autoLock(mLock); if (mDone) { break; } mCondition.waitRelative( mLock, fillingCache ? 1ll : 1000000000ll); [...] ----------------------------------------- Obviously, since the variable fillingCache is initialized to Q'EfalseQ'E, the first time through the loop will call mCondition.waitRelative() with a value of 1000000000ll, which wait for 1 second. 2/ In the same Prefetcher file, function status_t Prefetcher::prepare(), ---------------------------- status_t Prefetcher::prepare( bool (*continueFunc)(void *cookie), void *cookie) { // Fill the cache. int64_t duration; bool noMoreData; do { usleep(100000); if (continueFunc Q&EQ&E !(*continueFunc)(cookie)) { return -EINTR; } duration = getCachedDurationUs(Q&EnoMoreData); } while (!noMoreData Q&EQ&E duration Q<E 2000000ll); return OK; } ------------------------------ we can see that this loop has an unconditional usleep(100000) which means that it could be waiting up to 100ms after the prefetcher actually has filled the buffer. Finally 3/ The way the cached duration is computed in Q'Eduration = getCachedDurationUs(Q&EnoMoreData);Q'E calls void PrefetchedSource::updateCacheDuration_l() which does the following: ----------------------------------- void PrefetchedSource::updateCacheDuration_l() { if (mCachedBuffers.size() Q<E 2) { mCacheDurationUs = 0; } else { int64_t firstTimeUs, lastTimeUs; CHECK((*mCachedBuffers.begin())-Q>Emeta_data()-Q>EfindInt64( kKeyTime, Q&EfirstTimeUs)); CHECK((*--mCachedBuffers.end())-Q>Emeta_data()-Q>EfindInt64( kKeyTime, Q&ElastTimeUs)); mCacheDurationUs = lastTimeUs - firstTimeUs; } } --------------------------------- It looks like the first 2 cached buffers are ignored, so there will be an extra delay incurred because the Prefetcher::prepare() wonQ'Et return until the 3rd buffer."

These events add up pretty quickly and slow the phone down which is extremely frustrating. If I remove the exchange active sync account from the phone, I noticed the email and contacts are removed but the calendar events remain on the phone??

9781,wifi,"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 20:11:57 +0000","Wi-Fi always enters Power Save Polling (PSP) mode when screen off, causing problems for some app","It seems that, even with Q""EWifi Sleep PolicyQ""E set to Q""ENeverQ""E, the wifi on some Android devices will enter Power Save mode (a.k.a. PSP mode) when the screen turns off. PSP mode apparently causes the wifi device to sleep, but wake up periodically and ask its access point to deliver packets that were addressed to to the device while it was asleep. This necessarily causes additional, Q""EspikyQ""E network latency. This additional latency means that some network-oriented applications experience problems when the screen turns off. Most notably, Internet telephony app simply cannot make a call over wifi with the screen off. As soon as the screen goes off, the call becomes heavily garbled or mute in both directions. HereQ'Es the associated bug on Sipdroid: http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/issues/detail?id=268 Sipdroid has kludged a solution for this problem by forcing the screen to be on while a wifi call is in progress. Fring may do the same, but I do not use Fring enough to know. The best that any Internet telephony app could ever do in this situation is use a large buffer to smooth out the audio, but the resulting delay would always be similar to calling China from the United States. This also seems to cause problems with: * live-source streaming audio (app such as StreamFurious) * bulk data transfer rates (FTP) * potentially any app not designed for its connection quality to suddenly and dramatically change * potentially any app, if the access point drops any packets from its queue or is otherwise not-perfectly-behaved There are a number of issues in AndroidQ'Es queue already that seem to be the same or related to this issue: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7421 http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6611 http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9029 http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9590 From what IQ'Eve read, this seems to affect HTC phones mainly (maybe only). I also wonder if it couldnQ'Et be causing more nefarious issues than network latency. Intel has the idea that some access points simply donQ'Et play well with PSP mode: http://www.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/sb/cs-006205.htm In terms of solutions: A Q""ECAMQ""E (a.k.a. constant awake mode) type of WifiManager.WifiLock would allow app that need uninterrupted low-latency to request it.

THE ISSUE: If youQ'Eve set up an existing Google account on first boot of your mobile device and later try to do it again for whatever reason, the sync process consistently fails. After entering your credentials in Google Sync (Q""ESet up your Google accountQ""E) you get the message: Q""ESigning in... Your phone is communicating with Google servers and setting up your account. This may take up to five minutes.Q""E followed by: Q""ECanQ'Et establish a reliable data connection to the server. This could be a temporary problem or your SIM card may not be provisioned for data services. If it continues, call Customer Care.Q""E This happens even when a proper data connection (2G, 3G or WiFi) is present, i.e. browsing and everything else works fine. In my case, I had to set up my Google account anew after I had foolishly cleared the cache and data from the app Q""EGoogle appQ""E in the app manager. That caused all my contacts to be removed from the phone, so IQ'Eve been trying to retrieve them from GoogleQ'Es servers, but this doesnQ'Et work due to the sync fail. ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS: See http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail? id=3477 for related thread (for the HTC Hero). None of the solutions below worked for me, and I refuse to try (1) or (5). (1) The most commonly proposed solution is to perform a hard reset of the phone (Settings Q>E SD card Q&E phone storage Q>E Factory data reset), but this does not appear to work for all users, especially when a data connection is not present at first boot. Moreover, it wipes the device clear of all data, app and settings. Boo! (2) Another common suggestion is to clear the cache and data from the Q""EGoogle appQ""E app in the application manager. In my case, this is what caused all the trouble in the first place, but I had nothing else to lose so I tried it. Obviously, that didnQ'Et work, either. (3) It has been suggested that using a WiFi connection with or without a static IP address resolves the issue, but that changed nothing for me. (4) Someone also proposed setting the date and time correctly, but as far as I can tell, my phoneQ'Es date and time are in sync with my computer and indeed, with the rest of the world according to an atomic clock :) (5) Finally, there seems to be a workaround for all you hackers out there, where you delete the folder Q""E/data/data/com.android.providers.settingsQ""E, but for this to work your phone needs to be rooted, which is a dangerous and complicated process that I wish to avoid at all costs.

12110,UI keyboard,"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 09:40:53 +0000",Auto-Closure of Keyboard,"IQ'Eve begun to notice that in a lot of places where selecting something should prompt the soft-keyboard to go away automatically, it does not. Since thereQ'Es no simple and clear way for the user to make the above mentioned keyboard disappear (the Q'ECONTEXT MENUQ'E hardware hard button does this), it results in a non-intuitive way that sometimes causes/gives you an unexpected and undesired result. Some of situations where IQ'Eve found this particularly annoying, frustrating, and more difficult to deal with are detailed as follows. If IQ'Eve missed out something please add it to the comments below: -If IQ'Em searching for a Contact in my Address Book, I then choose his/her contact picture icon that shows me certain actions based on available information for the same. If I then select the Call option (and do not have a primary/preferred number setup for that person) then it shows me a list of all of the available numbers for that person. However itQ'Es really hard to scroll through these and you can never really see all of the numbers unless the on-screen keyboard is closed down, but this doesnQ'Et happen. Typically, IQ'Ed like for the keyboard to go away as soon as a select the contactQ'Es icon. -If youQ'Ere just generally choosing from a list of say, Radio Button-based options for example, and have been brought there by performing a search or some other interaction with the device that required soft keyboard usage, once again the same thing happens. The keyboard continues to remain present and persists during the course of the entire selection, hiding a few elements of the list in question itself, while also making it significantly more difficult to scroll through. Try this with a list of countries or something slightly larger and longer than the usual amount and youQ'Ell instantly get what I mean. IdQ'E like to have a mechanism whereby the OS is able to smartly detect and figure out when the user would no longer need the keyboard and get rid of it, much in the same way that it is able to figure out when the user does indeed need the use of the on-screen keyboard. The converse of this should be fairly easy to implement, in my opinion. IQ'Em running a stock version of Android Froyo on my Nexus One though I have checked and this behavior is replicated on both Sense UI on any HTC Phone (tested on the Desire running 2.2, the Aria and Wildfire running 2.1) as well as the Samsung Galaxy S (also on Eclair) which leads to the conclusion that this is again something that has been built deeply into the Android OS framework itself."

8065,contact bluetooth synchronize,"Sat, 01 May 2010 05:53:59 +0000",Contacts via Bluetooth - need restrictions / filtering to prevent overload due to Facebook,"I have noticed this on both the Moto Droid running 2.0.1 as well as the HTC Incredible running 2.1-update1. Scenario: Average user with a bunch of GMail contacts, perhaps an Exchange account for work, and Facebook, all synchronized to the phone. The contacts application already allows filtering by group, which is helpful on the phone itself so you arenQ'Et overloaded with info if you have a bunch of Facebook friends, or if you have many GMail contacts without phone numbers. However, letQ'Es use Bluetooth and pair with a full-featured system like a car, that pulls contacts off of the phone for touchscreen or gauge-cluster display. Imagine you have 300 Facebook friends along with maybe 100 Exchange contacts and another 200 GMail contacts. Due to Linking, you may have some of this cut down and merged, but it is still a LOT of contact info. You may not even care about the Facebook contacts. There is no way to filter out that contact information from the Bluetooth stack (and thus the car system). If you own a less-than-intelligent Bluetooth implementation in the car, it will blindly re-pull the contacts every time the phone connects - this isnQ'Et necessarily bad, but if youQ'Ere trying to avoid the problem by removing contacts from your car, they will just keep coming back... Solution: Implement a system that allows the user to select a specific grouping of contacts that will be made available for Bluetooth sync. If the user does nothing, sync everything, but if the user chooses to enable this option, it should work in one of two ways: 1. Allow the user to select a pre-existing group/category of contacts for Bluetooth access. If contacts are already categorized, allow them to create a new category in the contacts system and use multi-categorization to insure the correct contacts are available on Bluetooth. 2. Use a separate system from the normal contact categories. Access it via the Bluetooth settings and keep it totally segregated from the normal Contact system. Allow this system the flexibility to choose individual contacts, groups, or both. The goal in both options is to NOT lock the user into a specific grouping scheme. If they want to have groups for business/personal, allow those to remain and select individual contacts to be available via Bluetooth, or allow entire groups to be made available. For an example of a good, functional system, look at any recent BlackberryQ'Es Bluetooth contact sync filtering."

Perhaps the solution could be this: 1. Google release the new versions of Android and centrally update all terminals like Apple with iPhone 2. Google creates a new section into the Android Market, named as Android Platform Market, where developers can upload new graphic themes, new widgets and new patches for the operating system, for increasing the basic functionality, and where the AndroidQ'Euser can go and download the extra graphics feature or extra functional feature for his platform. So the Android Market Platform would have three sections: Themes, Widget, Extra. If Google organize Android platform in this way, the custom ROM development with advanced functionality (like Cyanogen) or advanced interfaces development (like HTC Sense UI) would reduce to the development of a package of patches and a the development graphic theme.

10305,wifi,"Mon, 09 Aug 2010 16:57:15 +0000",Report networks with hidden SSID when scanning Wi-Fi networks,"* Current behavior * When programmaticaly scanning Wi-Fi networks (using WifiManager.startScan() and WifiManager.getScanResults()), when the SSID broadcast is disabled on an access point and the access point has never been connected to the device, the ScanResult element for this access point does not appear in the list of access points returned. This was observed on Android HTC Hero (1.5, 2.1), HTC Desire (2.1), Nexus One (2.1, 2.2), Motorola Droid (2.0.1,2.1). * Prefered behavior * I would like to see the access points with hidden SSID appear in the ScanResult list at this programmatic level, either with SSID as an empty string, or with a particular constant string (e.g. android.net.wifi.WifiManager.WIFI_HIDDEN_SSID, to be defined). * Related issues * - http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6601 -Q>E scope seems to be wider than this actual feature request, but I am not interested in connecting the the access points. * Analysis * There is no reason at hardware level, for active Wi-Fi scans, not to show probe responses information from hidden-SSID access points. So the problem is probably software. Apparently the parsing of Wi-Fi scan results occurs in WifiService.parseScanResult() (in platform/frameworks/base.git/services/com/android/server/WifiService.java) The instanciation of a new ScanResult object is only done if the length of the (trimmed) SSID is Q>E0. It looks like an intentional choice. If the purpose of this feature is to avoid showing hidden access points in wifi management applications, I suggest using an empty SSID and add a flag to manage the hidden/visible property for the access point."

9070,contact synchronize,"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 18:48:36 +0000",Contacts sync - disappearing contacts and corrupt contact list,"These behaviors have been experienced with the Motorola Droid, HTC Hero, and others running Android Eclair 2.1 1. Disappearing contacts: Configuring a Google account on a device causes previously added local contacts to Q""EdisappearQ""E. Previously entered local contacts are lumped into a group called Q""EAll Other ContactsQ""E, and when synced are placed in the All Contacts area. By default the Q""EAll Other ContactsQ""E group is unchecked for display so the appearance to the user is that these locally entered contacts have been removed. In addition these local contacts have been lumped in with the potentially large and unmanaged Q""EAll ContactsQ""E list when synchronized. To Reproduce: - Start with a clean device (new or factory reset) - Add a contact local to the device (first and last name is all that is needed). - Configure a Google account on the device. During configuration, ensure that Auto-sync is enabled. It is easier to see the behavior using a Google account without any contacts, but this is not a limitation. - Return to the Contacts application. The previously added local contact should have disappeared from the contact list. - Sometimes the local contact is still visible; however, this is only temporary. To expedite the disappearance: - From the contact list select the Display Options or Display Groups menu item. - Select the Google account from the Display Options activity to display all of the available groups. - Press the Done button to close the activity and return to the contact list. - The locally added contact should no longer be visible Recommended behavior: Upon configuring a Google account, either add all previously entered contacts to the Google account Q""ESystem Group: My ContactsQ""E group that is checked for display by default or add them to another new group (I.E. Q""EDevice ContactsQ""E that is check for display by default. 2. Corrupt contact list: Associated with the disappearing contacts, adding contacts to a device with a configured Google account that has not been synchronized will cause the contact list to become corrupt. The corruption involves numerous Q""ESystem Group: My ContactsQ""E groups, unnamed groups, and deleted contacts. This has primarily been seen with Google accounts that are originally configured with Auto-sync disabled; however, the contact list can still become corrupt if the user adds a new contact before the initial sync has been completed. To Reproduce: - Start with a clean device (new or factory reset) - Configure a Google account on the device. During configuration, ensure that Auto-sync is disabled to prevent synchronizing the contacts or contact groups. It is easier to see the behavior using a Google account without any contacts, but this is not a limitation. - Open the Contacts application and navigate to the contact list. View the Google account groups available for display (Menu-Q>EDisplay Options or Display Groups-Q>ESelect Google account). There should be only one group that is named Q""EAll Other ContactsQ""E, and it should be unchecked. - Add a contact local to the device (first and last name is all that is needed). This contact should be added to the default Google account Q""ESystem Group: My ContactQ""E group. Since the account has never been synced and the correct Q""ESystem Group: My ContactsQ""E does not exist locally, the device creates one. - View the Google account groups available for display. There should now be two groups Q""EAll Other ContactsQ""E that is unchecked and Q""ESystem Group: My ContactsQ""E that is checked. - Add a second contact local to the device. This contact, and all additionally entered local contacts, are placed into an unnamed group that is unchecked for display by default. View the Google account groups available for display to see this group. Since this second contact was added to this unchecked group, it appears to the use that the contact failed to be added. - Return to the Accounts Q&E Sync configuration, and manually sync the contacts for this Google account. - After the sync is complete, return to the Contacts application, and view the Google account groups available for display. There should be at a minimum two Q""ESystem Group: My ContactsQ""E groups. The unnamed group has disappeared; however, adding a new contact local to the device will recreate the group. Also note, that the second contact added has been moved to the Q""EAll Other ContactsQ""E group. Recommended behavior: Lockout adding new contacts to the Contact application until the first sync of Google account groups has been performed. If Auto-sync has been disabled when the Google account is configured, automatically perform a one time sync of the Google account groups."

12286,android_market,"Mon, 01 Nov 2010 12:49:45 +0000","Show all applications in Android Market, warn/disallow user download if resolution/size/feature isnQ'Et compatible.","One of the major benefits of Android is that many manufacturers can adopt Android on to many different kinds of devices with different specifications meeting different needs. This essentially allows anyone to jump aboard the Android train: from budget conscious users wanting a basic Android device like the HTC Wildfire or the LG Optimus One, to those who must have the end-all and be-all device, like the Google Nexus one, Samsung Galaxy S or HTC Desire and corporations looking for an Android device that can enforce corporate policy. The main problem with many devices meeting many different needs is essentially fragmentation, but on a needs level, as opposed to a software level. Specifically, different types of screens and therefore screen resolutions, as well as disabled or non-existent software/hardware features and their relationship with the Android Market have created this problem. ItQ'Es disconcerting to search Android Market and to not find an application that works on a friends device (a Nexus One for example) but wonQ'Et on yours (a HTC Wildfire), because the application in question only supports 480x800 and not 240x320, or because the device does not sport a camera (Motorola Droid Pro) or because of security reasons enforced by corporate policy (through Android). I believe this creates a feeling of being a sub-par user of Android and therefore is detrimental to the Android experience. Not only that, many users would be unaware of this limitation and would be unable to lobby the developer for support of their device, and which Android appears to offer no facility to enable this link to communicate, because applications are hidden from view. I propose that instead of hiding applications from Android Market that are incompatible with specific screen resolutions, corporate policies or features, that the user be warned (perhaps be disallowed from downloading the application) because of this issue and that they should be encouraged to contact the developer to facilitate the change to make their application compatible, if this can happen. It would not only benefit consumers who at least know the application exists on Android Market but also benefit developers who would get increased exposure to all users of the Android Market (and not just those who are able to use the application) and be actively encouraged to develop their application(s) further by users, for not only consumers but the Android ecosystem. IQ'Eve included three mock-ups of the Android Market to visually show how this would work, if implemented, highlighting the screen size issue, as well as a third showing notices being stacked for multiple issues. The first (filename: marketview.jpg) shows the difference between an application that is compatible with the particular device as opposed to one that isnQ'Et. Notice that there is an exclamation symbol on the application that isnQ'Et compatible with a particular device or corporate policy. The second (filename: application.jpg) shows what the warning would look like if a particular user wanted to get more information on the application, or wanted to lobby their support for the addition of the screen size, for example. This can be done in two ways, first: a simple Q""ERegister supportQ""E button which acts in a similar way to Q'EStarringQ'E issues on Google Code and the second allows a user to contact the developer to ask questions or offer support (by way of contributing code, etc). By pressing the Q""ERegister supportQ""E button, this sends a notification to the developer that someone would like to see their particular resolution implemented (and which sends the device manufactuer name, model name and screen resolution) either by email or via their DeveloperQ'Es account. Q""EContact developerQ""E simply opens up an email form which allows inputting of queries or support. If a developer wishes, either or both of these options can be disabled and which Android Market only shows the notices, as opposed to simply hiding them. The options could be disabled for particular circumstances: if the application, by design, requires a feature that is disallowed by corporate policy (or isnQ'Et available in the first place), then the options would be automatically disabled. At the user end, Android Market could be configured to ignore (hide) applications that raise this warning, but display an additional inline notice: ?10 applications were hidden due to incompatibilities [Show These]?. - Expansion of this system - It could be argued that this notification system could indicate other incompatibilities, like an application requiring a camera to function correctly, which is not present in an Android device (i.e. Motorola Droid Pro (as for corporate security concerns)), or is incompatible with a corporate security policy (as enforced by Android) therefore allowing users to be aware of potential issues and which applications these issues affect, instead of just hiding them from the Q'EMarket and essentially denying they exist, which confuses users (through word of mouth that an application exists on Android Market but canQ'Et be found on particular devices) and which gives developers the opportunity to rectify issues, rather than cutting them off completely. The third image (filename: otherwarnings.jpg) shows issues being stacked, in this case, an application requiring a camera and that this particular application is incompatible with corporate policy (for example: a particular corporation forbids the use of GPS services, for whatever reason) therefore displaying the notices, again, rather than hiding the application."

12383,wifi,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 16:10:55 +0000",Wifi scans stopped after losing data connectivity,"** Summary: When data connectivity is lost, no more scan results will be sent to BroadcastReceivers for WifiManager.SCAN_RESULTS_AVAILABLE_ACTION intents. ** Impact: This problem prevents Wifi location technologies from being used seamless and continuously. It also seems to be very related to other issues with Wifi connections, although it is to be tracked as a separate problem (having scan results is different form having Wifi connectivity). ** Steps to reproduce: 0 - Use a phone without a SIM card (so that no other connectivity than Wifi is available). I used HTC Desire (version 2.2), Nexus One (version 2.1), and HTC Hero (version 2.1). (Only used one phone at a time.) 1 - Create an application that has a BroadCastReceiver, with: - some log / display in its Q""EonReceiveQ""E to show Access Point information - in register(): Q""EmyActivity.registerReceiver(this, mIntentFilter)Q""E - where the mIntentFilter has WifiManager.SCAN_RESULTS_AVAILABLE_ACTION as action. 2 - Add to your application a WifiLock in order to prevent scan interruptions when power is off: createWifiLock(WifiManager.WIFI_MODE_SCAN_ONLY, Q""Emy app lockQ""E); 3 - Power-up a standard Wifi access point (I used a NetGear Wireless-G router WRG614 v9, set to use channel 11, tried without authentication and with WPA authentication). 4 - associate the phone with the access point. 5 - Start your app ( =Q>E you can see the Wifi scan results coming) 6 - turn the wifi access point off ===Q>E RESULT: No more wifi scan results form your application after the phone has hidden the wifi connection icon in the status bar (and even a bit before to be more precise). This is true for ALL access points I tried, including free access points available in shopping malls etc. Additional info: I could reproduce the same behaviour when instead of using Wif connection, I disable all Wifi profiles and have a SIM card with 3G data connectivity established. I start the application and get Wifi information. Then I walk around while keeping the phone until I lose 3G connectivity ==Q>E No more Wifi scan info. ** Correct / Expected behaviour: Since the phone *has to* scan Wifi in order to provide the end user with the best Q&E cheapest connectivity available, it does not make any sense for Wifi scans not to give any information any more. Seeing the related problems, it looks like the impact is not just on Wifi scans, but also on actual speed of connection. ** Related issues: WARNING: the related issues below are only PARTIALLY related, in that: - they do NOT give the same step-by-step systematic reproduction procedure - they relate to having Wifi connection, NOT to having Wifi scan results. 2845, 4650, 1698, 6406, 6269.

11756,calling,"Thu, 07 Oct 2010 22:12:19 +0000",Can not make phone calls,"I was recently on travel in Asia with my VZW activated HTC Incredible phone with Android 2.2. Encountered several serious bugs with the Android o/s as stated below: 1)Could not place calls: I have international numbers stored in my phone phook; i.e for India, itQ'Es 011- followed by country code + city code and number. Now if if you are in India, you will need to use OO as access code instead of 001. If you enter the the 00 with copuntry code, city code and phone number, device will ignore your entry and will automatically use the same stored string which begins with 001. As a result you will not be able to call out the number no matter what you do. Steps to repro: Enter the phone number 011 919391919555 (I just picked up a random phone number of India) and store this in your phone book. Now try to dial out thro the keypad 00 919391919555; you will see phone will automatically use the above stored number. Device should ALWAYS use the number entered by the user instead of replacing it with stored phone number; you can do the name match by matching the last 10 or 8 digits but should never change the manula dial strings entered by the user. 2) Several lock ups or slow UI; this seems to be because phone was in 1x service and was taking long time to download e-mails; as a result UI gets slow response; but the interesting thing is I tried to access my call history with no response for about 15 seconds and then the device started placing automatic calls from my call history. So seems like when you are in active data session (upload/download e-mails), this OS gets VERY unstable if the user wants to make phone calls. I just seen this same issue this morning; had to literrally power down the phone coz the menus were not responding and couldnQ'Et make calls. Even when I tried to power down, it got stuck in the power down option menu (had to take the battery out to get out of this). NOTE: This form is only for reporting user bugs in 2.2.

10537,battery,"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 07:24:13 +0000","Android Q""EBattery UseQ""E statistics panel inaccurate on HTC Sense devices and/or easily tampered with (Desire in comparison with Nexus One)","Lately IQ'Eve been finding some disturbing battery use statistics in various custom ROMs, as well as the original HTC Android 2.2 ROM, on my HTC Desire. The problem is that, given a specific usage scenario (screen on nearly all the time with high brightness), the original HTC ROM (and subsequently, all custom ROMs based on it) reports battery use statistics which are more or less impossible. The symptoms: On the original HTC ROM, Q""EDisplayQ""E is typically under 20% (often under 10% during normal usage, even with the screen on for large amounts of time), and Q""EAndroid SystemQ""E is nearly always over 50%. The Nexus One, on the other hand, shows more or less the opposite: Very high Q""EDisplayQ""E usage (50-90%) and relatively low Q""EAndroid SystemQ""E usage, both of which are in line with both logic and the CPU time used by Q""EAndroid SystemQ""E (typically no more than 30 minutes with a full day of active use). Since the Nexus One is supposedly more or less the same device (same SoC, same or similar radios, same AMOLED display), these figures should be nearly the same, or at least similar. As is the case, according to HTCQ'Es battery use statistics, the AMOLED display in the Desire uses less than 20% of the power that the Nexus OneQ'Es AMOLED display uses. This is impossible, as further tests have shown. Testing: The most important of these tests was performed by th3 on the XDA-Developers forum. The test (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=7724953Q&Epostcount=184) was performed with HTCQ'Es battery use statistics on OpenDesire 3.1.0 (am AOSP ROM, compiled from source, but with HTCQ'Es battery use statistics - the results of the test are exactly in line with the results from HTCQ'Es original ROM), due to being able to easily measure the current being drawn from the battery on this ROM while still having HTCQ'Es original, but inaccurate, battery use statistics. The gist of the test: The device was left on with a fully white screen (highest possible power usage on AMOLED), at full brightness, until the battery drained completely from a full charge. The device was not used in this time, meaning the SoC was nearly fully idle, with the exception of taking some screenshots near the end. Even in this case, after nearly a full discharge with the screen consuming the maximum possible amount of power, the battery use statistics show Q""EDisplayQ""E as having used only 25%, with Q""EAndroid SystemQ""E at 70% even though the system was almost completely idle. Screenshot near the end of this test: http://img85.imageshack.us/i/screenshot26i.png/ Additionally, current draw figures for the system at idle with a black and for the system at idle with a white (full brightness) screen were ascertained: Black: 155mA White: 485mA Even if we assume that the display draws no power at all when it is black, due to not needing to emit light (which is not the case, as changing the Q""EbrightnessQ""E of the black display causes relatively linear changes in power consumption), this means that the screen must have accounted for _at least_ 330mA of power draw, without any change in SoC power use, since both tests were performed with an idle system. 330mA out of 485mA total works out to roughly 68% of the total current being drawn by the display. Once again, during this usage, HTCQ'Es battery use statistics on the Desire display showed only 25% Q""EDisplayQ""E battery usage. This alone proves that HTCQ'Es battery use statistics implementation on the Desire is either buggy or has been tampered with for some reason. In addition, tests performed with ROMs built from Android 2.2 source (not based on HTCQ'Es original Desire ROM) are perfectly in line with the power consumption of the Nexus One, as well as with measured current measurements. And one last piece of (albeit anecdotal, to be taken at facae value) evidence: Changing the display brightness has a very, very noticable effect on battery life during normal day-to-day use, suggesting that the display is indeed one of the most power hungry components in AMOLED Desires. Concluion: This situation is, unfortunately, very counterproductive, because: a) HTCQ'Es Desire ROM provides no objective reference for power consumption testing (if the Q""EDisplayQ""E and Q""EAndroid SystemQ""E are wrong by such an incredibly large margin, everything else could be completely wrong as well) b) This causes questions to arise concerning the accuracy and reliablitlity of battery use statistics across all Android builds. If HTC has managed to provide such wrong statistics on the Desire through a simple bug or tampering, why not other manufacturers/devices? Therefore, I propose that Android needs a consolidated method of measuring battery use across all different devices, without the ability for manufacturers and/or custom ROM developers to tweak battery use figures in order to make their devices or software builds seem more efficient than others. For example: HTC Desire users really are partially under the impression that their AMOLED screens use far less power than the same (or at least very similar) screen on the Nexus One. However, this is only due to the bug/tampering in the battery use statistics on the HTC DesireQ'Es Sense platform. This issue is also being reported to HTC so that the specific issue can be fixed for future HTC Sense releases (IQ'Em assuming the issues are present in HTC Sense releases for other HTC devices as well), but it needs to be dealt with in Android in general, to make situations like this impossible in the future.

10889,synchronize,"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 04:58:15 +0000",Provide a clear list of supported/unsupported Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) policies,"I have a Nexus One with 2.2 on it.

After we switched I get the following error when trying to setup my Exchange email account: Q""EThis server requires security features your phone does not support.Q""E Now obviously if it worked before and the only thing that changed was the server than I know that the server should be blamed and not the phone.

My Exchange admins are willing to work with me to help fix the policy to support my phone, however we already have a pretty lax policy that really just requires a password of some type and length and pretty much everything else is allowed. Running debugs from the Email.apk program does not produce any indication of the policy that my phone is failing or not meeting and there is little we are getting from the server side. So long post short: I need to find a clear and concise list of policies officially supported in Froyo and which policies are not supported. The only lists that have been given can be found at http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.2-highlights.html which is just a marketing bullet list and is of no use to my problem.

Other HTC and Motorola android users are able to connect up to this same policy without any issues (not to mention the snooty iPhone and the poor WinMo users who are also enjoying EAS without any problems) Also if there is a way to debug on the phone (or server even) to find out specifically what policy my phone is failing that would be great as well.

12797,contact,"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 10:08:17 +0000",* Contacts shown multiple times in drop down list while adding message recepients in message Application,"The Message application displays the same contacts multiple times in contact dropdown list shown while adding recipient for messaging. If we check contacts through People application, then there are no duplicate contacts in it. Also, in View setting, only the contacts from Phone memory is selected. So, I can not see any reason to display the contacts multiple times in dropdown list while adding them in recipient list. One more thing I would like to highlight is: In settings, if we have selected to show Q'EOnly contacts having numbersQ'E OR to view Phone contacts Q&E not to show GMAIL contacts. In this case when we write any message and tries to add recipient in to, at that time it shows all contacts avaialable. Like Phone, GMAIL etc. If we have already done setting for contact display, then it should be followed while messaging too. But instead of that, it displays all contacts which then creates confusion while sending bulk SMS. Many of the times some contacts with mail ids gets selected in that bulk and SMS gets converted to MMS because of it. And as the added contacts just display the names, its really very dificult to find the perticular contact because of which SMS got converted to MMS. - Steps to reproduce the problem. Go to Message-Q>E New Message, add try to add recipients. Here it will show same contacts multiple times in drop down list. - What happened. Not sure. - What you think the correct behavior should be. The correct behaviour should be like, it should not show duplicate contacts and should use the settings done in People application for displaying and adding contacts in messages.

8064,android_market,"Sat, 01 May 2010 03:21:18 +0000",Market: Conflict Google and Google app accounts,"Device Info: ------------ HTC Desire - Telstra (AU) Firmware: 2.1-update1 Kernel version 2.6.29-3cb3dfbf Build number: 1.16.841.1.CL171554 release-keys Software number: 1.16.841.1 Bug Description --------------- When a user has both a Google account, and a Google app account (ie the users mail domain is hosted by Google) and the user registers his/her Google app account on the phone (for access to email, calendar etc) the Market will not allow the user to log in to Market with their standard Google account. (Invalid password error is returned, even though the correct password is entered) Steps to Reproduce Defect ------------------------- 1) Create a Google app (Google app For Your Domain) account and create a primary email address (eg user@example.com with password1) 2) Create a standard Google account and use the email address created in step #1 above (eg user@example.com with password2) as the primary email address. Set up Google Checkout on this account. 3) Factory reset Android phone 4) During initial setup wizard enter the Google app account (eg user@example.com with password1) 5) Start the Market app, and try to log on with the standard Google account (eg ser@example.com with password2) ==Q>E Invalid password error Correct Behaviour ----------------- User should be prompted to choose if the account details they are entering needs to be authenticated as a Google account or a Google app account. (This may be better done at an OS level rather than specifically for the Market app. Impact ------ The impact to affected users is very high, as it means they cannot purchase paid app from the Android store. This scenario is very common as every Google app user also needs a secondary Google account to access any services such as YouTube, Picasa, Google Checkout, iGoogle etc etc This defect appears to affect every version of Android Market, and every Android device so is very widespread. The Android Market does not provide any other alternatives to purchasing app (ie there is no way to purchase from the PC using a web browser to work around this issue) Workaround ---------- As this is a common issue, a workaround has been identified: http://www.matthewmcdonald.com/132 This workaround has certain limitations: 1) The user has to change their primary email address on their Google account 2) Changing the primary email address can cause other services which use Google accounts for authentication to fail (eg the user will be locked out of their AppBrain account) Notes ----- This defect appears to be because Android has no option to specifiy if an account is a standard Google account or a Google app account This bug is similar to #2322, but that is logged as a feature request rather than a defect, and is not currently being worked on) Once the user has logged onto the Market app with a valid account (eg Google app) it is not possible to change accounts without doing a hard reset of the device."

The data icon appears shortly after I enter google maps with GPS enabled and no other data connection (wifi) available. It doesnQ'Et happen if I have wifi connected. The mobile data is disabled in settings. After I see the data icon, the phone is connected to either 3g or 2g(gprs, edge) data networks, because it loads the map sections when I scroll. If I leave the google maps, the gps icon disappears, but data icon doesnQ'Et. I can use the data connection with the other applications now. If I disable the GPS, the data connection remains alive. If I enable the data connection from the options (itQ'Es disabled there) and then disable it, the data connection icon disappears for a few seconds, but then reappears again. I canQ'Et turn off the data connection normally. If I successfuly connect to wifi, the data connection disables and remains that way after I disconnect from wifi (normalizes situation).

12108,calendar,"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 09:22:01 +0000",Alarm Reminders for Calendar,"IQ'Ed like to have the ability to setup an alarm based on a Calendar Entry. Currently, the only thing that the stock calendar app supports is reminders via a simple notification system similar to notifications received on the tray/bar at the top from any other 3rd party app, or the Messaging or Gmail/Email app etc. This is very basic functionality and the OS provides me with absolutely nothing else. What IQ'Ed like to really see is he ability to setup an alarm that corresponds with the calendar entry. For example, perhaps ring an alarm to signify that the meeting should have begun or even ended. Or maybe, say I have an appointment earlier than usual. I would like to therefore wake up earlier than usual as a special case and I need an hour from the time I wake up to the time IQ'Em at my workplace. So I set it up to ring an alarm an hour before the meeting scheduled time on that day, through the calendar itself. This saves me the trouble of the extra bunch of steps to first manually setup the appointment times with a simple reminder and then go into the alarm app to configure the appropriate time settings for that match up with it. More ambitiously, perhaps it is even able to figure out that if an alarm request comes in through the calendar, it gives me the option to turn off my regular alarm for that day only, so that, if for example, I am in a meeting at the time that I would usually wake up (based on the same aforementioned scenario) I either have to remember to disable the regular alarm an then turn it back on for the next days, or else run the risk of having it ring during the meeting or forget to turn it back on after. IQ'Em running a stock version of Android Froyo on my Nexus One though I have checked and this behavior is replicated on both Sense UI on any HTC Phone (tested on the Desire running 2.2, the Aria and Wildfire running 2.1) as well as the Samsung Galaxy S (also on Eclair) which leads to the conclusion that this is again something that has been built deeply into the Android OS framework itself."

9580,UI,"Wed, 07 Jul 2010 08:35:54 +0000",Improved AppWidget functionality,"The AppWidget framework launched in 1.5 provide some great functionality and provide a unique selling point for Android, making simple widgets easy to develop. Unfortunately they have some limitations. The understanding is that this is due in some parts to security issues and in some parts to battery life. An examination of the high quality widgets available under HTCQ'Es SenseUI shows that HTC have had to create a new HomeScreen type application to achieve their improved functionality. I would propose that the basic AppWidget framework be enhanced to allow more impressive widgets to be developed for the standard Android homescreen, without the need for developers to create additional homescreens. 1. EditText fields. This is probably the most asked for item on the Android developers list. The AppWidget framework does not support EditText, but only TextView. The secure RemoteViews interface only allows data to be passed TO the Widget, and not returned FROM it. An enhancement here would be very welcome. 2. Animation. This is again a very often requested feature. There are in fact a couple of hacky ways to get some tween and frame animations in AppWidgets, but a better solution would be for them to be fully supported natively. The objection usually raised here is of battery life, but this could be solved by only performing such animation or redraws when an AppWidget is actually visible on screen. When it is off screen, or the phone is sleeping, they would not be animating. An examination of the HTC widgets such as the Bookmarks widget, where a short animation of a spinning globe is played every time the widget is scrolled into view shows how nice this could be. This is not even a permanent animation, but the introduction of LiveWallpapers has made it clear that users are in fact happy with permanent animations playing, they seem prepared for the trade off with battery life. As long as the animations are not running when off screen, the battery drain is reduced. 3. Scrolling within Widgets. Being able to display a list of data in an AppWidget is one thing, but being able to vertically scroll within that list vastly increases the usefulness of the widget. The only objection I have heard to this is that capturing the vertical scroll event within a widget would then mean that event could not be guaranteed to be useful in some future implementation of Android which actually processed vertical scrolls in the home screen. For example, horizontal scroll events are used to scroll the home screen panels left and right, as screens are laid out that way. If a future homescreen was laid out vertically, or maybe both horizontally and vertically as a grid of screen panels, then a vertical scroll event would be required to navigate the list, and having that potentially clash with an AppWidget vertical scroll would be a problem. However, it seems that vertical scrolling within widgets would be useful right now, versus some potential future need that might never happen. The most common response to functionality requests such as the above is the suggestion to instead write a new home screen application which supports the requested features. However, most developers do not have the resources of large companies such as HTC, and it is hence not really practical for them to have to write a new Homescreen application in order to get the simple additional widget functionality they want. In addition, not many users will be willing to install a homescreen just to get a particular Appwidget. In summary, the AppWidget framework currently provides a clear distinctive advantage over other Mobile UIs, but it needs enhancing. Android needs to keep one step ahead and continue to lead in this area."

You simply hold your finger over a word and a magnifier bubble appear making easy to PRECISELY move the cursor where you want . the selection tool is really good too .

This feature is REALLY missing on android system and you can find posts about that on almost all android forum .

When I would delete this particular email, whether from Outlook, OWA, or my phone, sync would resume and work perfectly for a couple days until the next Sharepoint calendar email would arrive and then it would halt until that email was deleted. I created a rule to automatically move those emails to a different folder so my emails can continue to sync. the correct behavior of course would be that mail syncs 100% of the time. I also believe that if sync is going to fail on email that I should have a notification that makes it obvious that email isnQ'Et syncing so I can fix it or at least know IQ'Em not getting emails.

Wireless is configured with WPA2/AES. All devices connect correctly to the WLAN. Devices other than the HTC DesireQ'Es (we have two) can browse without incident. The HTC Desire handsets browse the majority of sites correctly and most apps work as they should, however, some do not. For example, the Facebook app (ver 1.5.1) never populates the News Feed. Older version 1.3 of the Facebook app works correctly. This is not specific to the Facebook app however as some web pages fail to load at all and others, including www.google.co.uk only partially load. Google UK loads enough to do a search, but sometimes will not complete the load to provide access to top tools links. Examples of pages that fail to load at all are; www.adobe.com z7.invisionfree.com/a_wedding_forum/index.php?act=idx The WLAN itself is not the issue since other devices work fine. I have tested removing all security on the WLAN and this had no effect. I have modified the router firewall to allow all traffic in and out to/from any source/target and this made no difference. I start to wonder if the common thread is something to do with Flash, since the adobe homepage wonQ'Et connect and there is some evidence that other affected sites have Flash content. IQ'Em not sure what the Facebook app uses. These problems were not apparent using a Netgear DGN2000 router or a Huawei Echolife HG520b router. I emphasise though that other devices are having no trouble with the Cisco now in place. Any ideas greatly welcome. Thanks Scott"
18193,video,"Sat, 02 Jul 2011 08:22:50 +0000","MP4 and 3GP file links do not work on Android, especially while texting but also in Email and Web.","When opening a download link to an mp4 file, the current behaviour is: Open text message, tap link, browser opens, browser sends link to Player, player exits, Q""EFile cannot be playedQ""E is displayed. Standard download link behaviour (mp3 for instance) is: Open text message, tap link, browser opens, browser sends link to Downloads, Downloads opens filename confirmation Dialog, tap OK, file downloads, Download Complete notification appears, tap notification, Downloads sends local (sdcard/download) path to Player, Player views file. This behaviour would work great for me, since I use cell and not WiFi service, thus streaming is tenuous at best. Even a long press does not work with current mp4 behaviour, since most links are in bit.ly or DropBox shortened formats. Preferred behaviour would be (to maintain choice and compatibility with streaming mp4 files): Open text message, tap link, system offers Share to dialog, with Downloads and streaming video Player listed as options. IQ'Em using an HTC Evo 4G with 2.3 Ginger, also tested on Evo with 2.2 Froyo, Evo Shift, Droid X, and MyTouch. Same behaviour. Default mp4 link handling is consistently broken. I suggest that the easiest fix is to treat them like all other file types the browser cannot open by itself: download them."
14294,message,"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 13:36:15 +0000",SMS sent to wrong contact even if right tread is opened,"This is an issue found on a HTC Desire running Android 2.2. After texting with person A, I close the message-application. When reopening the application I click on a tread with person B, and write a message and send it. Afterwards I receive a message from person A wondering what I am talking about. So, it seems like the app sends the message to the last person I received a message from (Person A) instead of person B who was supposed to receive the message. I have also experienced that a message sent to person A is placed in person BQ'Es tread, even if it was the right person (person A) who received it. This has resulted in me sending a message to person B telling him that I am sorry for the SMS that he was not supposed to receive. I have noticed that this seems to happen only if I do not let the application refresh the SMS-treads before I click on a tread and compose a new message. The thing is that if I have many treads and many messages in each tread, it will take some seconds before it has refreshed proper, and if I am in a hurry, this is not something I have on my mind and I might click on a tread before the treads is refreshed."

Our conclusion is that the Android falsely responds to ARP requests for other IP addresses than its own. Our resolution so far is to ban Androids from our network. Also, I have googled this extensively, and it seems to be an old problem, although nobody has diagnosed it deep enough to realize that there is no actual IP address conflict - but rather just a pretty obvious bug in the Android TCP/IP stack.

15542,wifi,"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 13:02:16 +0000","wifi policy set to never sleep, yet it does.  (bcm4329 disconnects when in powersave mode)","HTC Evo running android 2.3.3 (CM7, tried RC2 as well as the nightlies up to #21), although IQ'Em pretty sure this bug affects a large number of users who have the bcm4329 wifi chipset. I have my wifi sleep policy set to NEVER sleep. The problem is that when the screen is off for about 20-30 minutes, the wifi disconnects (ie, the phone becomes unpingable). Upon waking up, the phone immediately reconnects to wifi. The correct behavior is that when the phone is asleep, the wifi enters a powersave mode, latency increases, bandwidth decreases, but the phone STAYS CONNECTED to the wifi. This is 100% reproducable every time. The rumor is that this bug affects any bcm4329 chip whose MAC address begins with 38:e7, and does NOT affect bcm4329 chips whose MAC begins with 00:, although I can not confirm. My deviceQ'Es MAC does begin with 38:e7. (source of rumor: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=727332) ================================= There have been a lot of similar bugs reported by people who use VOIP. The main 2 problems for them are that: #1.) Their screen turns off in a call, causing wifi to enter powersave mode, causing latency to go up, causing the call to become garbled. and #2.) Their wifi disconnects (like mine) when the screen has been off for a while. Here is a possibly related bug: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9781 Here is one suggested solution, which is a modified bcm4329 driver that will NEVER enter the PM_MAX (powersave) mode: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=7638714#post7638714 However this would use a LOT more power. =================================== The main difference is that my bug relates to the wifi DISCONNECTING when the screen has been off for a while. I think it is 100% acceptable (correct) that the wifi enters a low power state when sleeping, so long as it does not disconnect. I have heard that the 2.3 API has a new wifi lock called WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF that will prevent the phone from ever entering powersave mode. That is a nice solution for some people, but does not fix *this* bug. Thank you."

The list is clearly sorted by last message received time, yet this was still showing as (I assume) sorted by the time I made that draft message, some weeks ago. Correct behaviour should be that regardless of a draft being there, that conversation should be sorted to the top of the list, since it has a new, unread text message.

Afterwards, when RFCOMM sockets connects, it says connection successful. Data sent to the phone from remote device is successfully received by the phone. But data sent from the phone is not received by the remote device. (although phone says successfully sent data on socket). Environment: System : HTC-EVO Android version : 2.2 Baseband version: 2.15.00.11.19 Kernel version : 2.6.32.17-gee557fd htc-kernel@and-18-2 #15 Build number : 3.70.651.1 CL294884 release-keys Software number : 3.70.650.1 Browse version : Webkit 3.1 PRI version : 1.90_003 PRL Version : 60680 We are facing the following scenario -- Our app uses bluetooth RFCOMM socket to communicate with other devices. The current case occured with linux ubuntu 9+ versions, with bluez 4.88+. The android app has native code, has multiple threads, including native threads that are attached to the java vm by jni calls. In some execution path of the app, an RFCOMM socket is closed from one thread and afterwards, another thread attempts to write on the socket, and gets IOException. Then the socket is closed by the latter thread (sender). No exception in this second close. At this point, something happens in the deviceQ'Es bluetooth stack and it gets corrupted. The behavior we get on subsequent sessions of the app (I mean if we close the app, and then run again) is --- The app connects with the remote device successfully. It receives all the data sent by the remote device. However, the remote device does not receive any of the packets sent from the phone. Packet level trace from hcidump confirms this. This behavior persists any subsequent sessions of the app, until the Android phone is rebooted. Same behavior (connected successfully but no data transferred one way) is observed with other simple test app that uses SPP, in this corrupted state. I have attached 2 log files. Phone.log shows when the system goes into corrupted state. hcidump.log shows that in the corrupted state connection is established successfully, data is sent from the remote-device (x86 ubuntu) but nothing is received. Phone.log shows the data transfers in the corresponding session."

We have also noticed that visiting secure sites, such as those providing internet banking, in the browser of one of the effected devices results in an Security warning dialog being displayed; this is not the case for the same websites on 2.2 devices. We have had limited success in providing users with reliable reproducible steps to fix the problem. We have suggested factory resets, device reboots, and similar, and these seem to have worked in one or two cases, but not consistently.

I also tried deleting the google apps account but Android would not let me do this, reporting that Q""Ean applicationQ""E needed it and the only solution would be to reset to factory defaults. Ultimately, I gave up and reset my google apps account password back to the old value, and after rebooting the phone everything worked fine again. I am amazed that such basic functionality as a password change is not supported in a straightforward way, maybe not at all short of factory reset?!?"

The wireless network requires Web authentication (e.g., typing in a username and password before access is granted). It wouldnQ'Et be a big deal if the login session didnQ'Et periodically expire, forcing me to open a Browser instance and load a web page for it to re-authenticate, often on an hourly basis throughout the day. This annoyance is in stark contrast with AppleQ'Es iOS implementation of automatic Web authentication. When iOS detects the Wi-Fi network needs Web credentials, it unobtrusively opens a browser automatically to log the user in. There are apps in the Android market that address this problem, but why pay for an app to achieve the same thing that AppleQ'Es offerings do for free? Adding this feature would solve a major problem I face on a daily basis. My device connects to the Wi-Fi network automatically, but without manual Web authentication, the phoneQ'Es data access is blocked, hindering productivity and making for a pretty lousy user experience."

My problem is that the phone mixes up contacts that have a similar number. The only difference between the two numbers is the area code. When one of them calls, it displays on the caller ID the name of another. Also, and more importantly, when I go to send an SMS to one of them it shows the name of the other. Same when receiving SMS from them. When I reply to the SMS it always goes to the person whoQ'Es name shows up in the messages thread, not the person who actually sent the sms to me. I also noticed that it defaults to the contact whoQ'Es name is first alphabetically. Here is exactly whatQ'Es happening. I have 2 contacts Mark - (517) XXX-XXXX Nataly - (847) XXX-XXXX XXX-XXXX are the same! Whenever either one of them calls caller ID shows Mark. When I want to send Nataly SMS I select her from contacts, but as soon as in the messages app MarkQ'Es name appears even though the number is NatalyQ'Es. The first SMS goes to Nataly, she replies, but the reply shows up in the same conversation thread as one coming from Mark. When I reply to that if goes to Mark. Same think when Nataly sends me an SMS it shows up as if Mark sent it to me and if I reply it goes to Mark even though the reply should go to Nataly. Did a hard reset, nothing. Reloaded the RUU, nothing. I went to the sprint store and exchanged the phone and it does the same thing. I tried the HTC Evo Shift and regular HTC Evo they had on display and they both did this. Tired a couple of other Android phones on display like Samsung and LG and they did not have this problem. However, I also own HTC Desire (CDMA from US Cellular) also running Android 2.2 Froyo.

During my train-ride the Maps app (v5.9.0) kept alternating between Rotterdam and the actual location, at the end of my trip this was 200 km apart.

During my trainride, a huge number of other access-points where picked up along the route, but the one in the train had the highest link quality. To improve the situation, moving access-points should probably be blacklisted, or at least get a much lower weight (e.g. only give indication what country you are in, unless you are in an International train...). Since Wifi access in trains become more common (buses, ships and planes are probably next), more people will experience this, also at the train station itself where GPS is not likely to work and multiple access-points move in and out. A way to gather all these access-points could be to ask the train/wifi companies, to scan at a transit point like Utrecht where most wifi-enabled trains pass by, or to correlate GPS locations of users with the access-point locations in their neighborhood.

The radio have the latest software, and bluetooth device was delivered with 3.12 software. All latest according to Kenwood webpage. Bluetooth Dip switches are set according to advise from Kenwood website. IQ'Em having two andoid phones, and both of them is using android version: 2.3.3. Phone one is HTC Desire Z and number two is Samsung Galaxy S2(GT-I9100). Both of them are behaving same way. They do a fine connection to the KCA-BT300, calls can be handled and phonebook is transfered, playing audio from the phone and trough the radio works. But not very clear sound. Phone calls are in so low quality in both RX and TX direction, so a call can not be understood and hence this function needs to be disabled. Playing audio is with clicking noise. I have tried to pair the phones with the bluetooth device (KCA-BT300), first initiated from the radio, then erase all bluetooth profiles. Then I paired from the phone. No matter, the radio system behaves as explained. According to website of Kenwood, I see that this module can use Bluetooth Ver. 2.1 + EDR and is certified. HTC are using Bluetooth? 2.1 with Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). Samsung Galaxy phone uses BT v3.0 + HS, or lower. So both phones are compatible with the Kenwood KCA-BT300, I think (KCA-BT300 is a Parrot device). Does someone know which Parrot device, and if a Parrot software can be uploaded to solve this issue. What do I do wrong and what can be done to improve sound. Best regards Torben"

However, IQ'Eve recently came across couple of small issues which I assumed that will be standard on all phones. IQ'Eve noticed that you do not have the option to forward an sms as an email (which is something that you can do on a blackberry) and although you can forward an sms and put an email address instead of a phone number what you get is an MMS (which probably is not free as an email would be) and it appears as a picture message to the receiver (you cannot see the content unless you log on to a web page etc etc). So the only current way to forward an sms is to copy the text and paste it on an email, which is a bit of fuf. The other thing IQ'Eve noticed is that when you reply to sms you are not given the option to add additional recipients to the response. So if I receive and sms from a friend and in my response I would like to copy another friend I cannot do this. Again this is probably a standard on other platforms. I hope that I provide an adequate description to the two issues. Please email me if you need more information. Lets make android the best operating system for our phones!"

If I havenQ'Et been using my phone for a little while and want to make sure it is off, I have to press the start/wake button. If my phone is in standby, no problem, it wakes up and I can turn it off. However, if it was already off, the phone then boots up, which I have to wait for it to finish, just to turn it off again. In contrast, when turning the phone off there is a distinct difference between the time needed to shut it off versus just putting it into standby. It would be nice if the same time requirements existed for waking/turning on the phone. That way an Q'EoffQ'E phone wouldnQ'Et turn on if I quick-tapped to try and wake it. Alternatively, some other method of waking but not turning on the phone could be programmed into the operating system."

15971,UI system,"Tue, 05 Apr 2011 08:33:48 +0000",Buttons can get stuck on if they are disabled during prepress (race condition),"Reproduced on Android 2.2 (HTC Desire), but appears to be generic. Our app includes Q""EforwardQ""E and Q""EbackQ""E buttons, which may be pressed multiple times, and become disabled when the last (or first) item is reached. If you hammer on a button until it becomes disabled, about 60% of the time the button get stuck in the pressed state (green background). A test activity with a single button and the following click handler serves to reproduce the issue: boolean firstTime = true; public void onClick(final View btn) { if (firstTime) { btn.postDelayed(new Runnable() { public void run() { btn.setEnabled(false); btn.setPressed(false); } }, 300); } firstTime = false; } Hammer on the button until it becomes disabled, and if the timing is right the button will get stuck in the Q""EpressedQ""E state. This appears to be caused by the View.CheckForTap callback, which sets the view to pressed; if the pointer-up event is ignored due to the view being disabled the state will never be cleared. Adding the line Q""Ebtn.cancelLongPress()Q""E to the callback above makes the problem go away, presumably because it calls View.removeTapCallback(). Modifying View.setEnabled() to call removeTapCallback() when the view is disabled should prevent this perplexing problem."

14276,email,"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 22:52:01 +0000",eMail client crashes on certain mail,"When I open the standard Android EMail Application, it refreshes and parses my inbox. I can scroll through the inbox or even load and read a message, if I am quick, but after a few seconds, the email app crashes with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This happens as long as the attached message is in the Inbox. When I remove and compact Inbox with my desktop client, no more crashes appear. When I move the message back in, it crashes again. I have sent a detailed error report once or twice via the automated crash reporter. In Preview, I saw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, probably while trying to crash the message. I donQ'Et know where those reports go, and I canQ'Et see it in my Mail or GMail outbox, so I canQ'Et provide the stack trace. While this one is most probably malformed, the user is not responsible for receiving wellformed mails. So while it would be acceptable for the mail client to deny displaying the message with an short notification, it is not ok for the whole app to crash. Especially since this happened every time after startup, without touching the bad message, so the user has no chance to find or remove the bad message without a desktop client. I scrambled my personal info in the attached message. It this does not reproduce, I can provide the original one to a developer (but not to the public bugtracker).

In my Gingerbread build, the phone will also randomly wake itself up with the screen at 100% brightness and shut down later (either by my pressing of the lock button or the screen timing out) The first bug can easily be reproduced by pressing the lock button then pressing it before the lock animation (CRT effect) is complete or by pressing it immediately after the animation finished (within 1-2 seconds) The latter bug, the phone coming on itself happens mostly when contact is made on the screen during the lock animation, it seems a long press can still register during the animation and this will in turn reawaken the phone.... However, there are rare occurences where the phone will completely awaken all on itQ'Es own. For the first issue, the phones brightness should be at the user defined setting, not at full brightness after a brief reawakening. For the latter issue, the digitizer should shut off at the start of the animation to prevent the phone from reawakening."

13837,app,"Sat, 08 Jan 2011 08:15:54 +0000",All-In-One Communications App needed,"Android has many different applications that are intended for communication with other people. Examples: * Phone, SMS, and Contact Manager App * (Google) Mail * Twitter * Facebook * Newsfeed Reader * (Google) Chat + Video Conferencing * etc. I donQ'Et like this, because this applications reflect channels that are used to communicate with friends. They are not based on the user workflow perspective. Instead of many different applications that are intended to do the same task - only on different channels. There has to be a single application. Each channel should be added using plugins - using an specific API - which can be provided over the android market by 3rd party developers. There may be plugins for additional sozial networks including Qzone, Soup.io or StudiVZ. ----------- A user wants to send messages to a single user or group of users. Its not a nice workflow to open the first app and post a message and then open a 2nd app to post the same message again. ----------- Also, the user doesnQ'Et open one app to stay up-to-date about the users in the one channel, and then open another app to get the news from another channel. In my experience, I tend to use only facebook while ignoring my friends on twitter, because of the bigger user group. The other groups will get ignored. So, there should be a singe timeview that merges the messages from all channels. There might be some filter-buttons to disable some channels (ie. hiding RSS/Atom-Feeds and E-Mails). Note: I like the way how Gwibber and the HTC Q'EFriend StreamQ'E-Widget are doing this task very well by combining twitter and facebook into a single application. ----------- What I really love on my Phone with HTC Sense is the possibility to import contacts from various sources and link them together. It does so by saving xml data in google contacts. What I like to have is a central contact management application. Instead of different applications for different communication channels, the communication channels have to be transparent. ----------- An all-in-one communication application need to be able to do: * Import of accounts from Contacts, GMail, Facebook, Twitter, etc. * Merging contacts. Providing different channels (facebook, twitter, phone number, postal address) to contact a person. * Organizing Peoples into Groups. Messages need to be able to sent to all persons from a given group. Examples of such groups are Family, Friends, Colleagues, and Public (All). Note: A similar behavior is implemented in Diaspora. Note: There might be issues with this on platforms like twitter and facebook, where all messages are either fully public or private to all contacts (friends). In this case, a little warning with Q'Ea do not show this warning anymoreQ'E-checkbox might appear, that the message will be able to be seen by all friends. Note: the contact import and contact management might be done using a different application on the same API, so that the interface will be more clear. * The user needs to be able to define which channels are to be used. This might be done using small on/off buttons right before the sent button. Ie. the user disables the SMS-Channel by disabling the envelope symbol. This is because SMS probably cost money. On the other hand a user might to send a message to all friends on christmas or new-year. The messaging app should send an E-Mail only if there is no facebook or twitter account associated. And it should only send SMS, if there is no E-Mail, Facebook and twitter account. It thus, chooses automatically the best way to contact the other users."

15876,message display,"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 23:51:13 +0000",Text Message Timing and Ordering,"Please describe the problem in detail. Be sure to include: - Steps to reproduce the problem. - What happened. - What you think the correct behavior should be. When sending/receiving text messages in a close time frame, the order of display will occasionally be incorrect. Presumably this is because the SMS application orders text messages by hour and minute sent, and then by some other factor (such as alphabetically). This causes the display order of messages to be incorrect. Whilst not a major bug, it can lead to conversation orders making no sense, and is generally annoying. The correct behavior would be listing the messages in the order that they were sent/received, regardless of how close together. By increasing the accuracy of the ordering to seconds, or even ms, this could easily be solved. This issue was found on a HTC Desire, running Android Version 2.2."
19083,battery display,"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 22:12:53 +0000",Orange led does not come in when battery get low after full charge,"HTC Sensation, Android 2.3.3, Sense 3.0 This bug will probably be specific to Sensation, but, reveals a coding failure anyway. Plug the phone on charger (I mean, legacy HTC charger). Let the phone charge up to 100%: the solid orange led switches to solid green. Start power consuming apps (permanent screen on for developer mode, GPS software with active work to do, Wifi downloads or heavy updates, and some CPU intensive tasks). Now, leave the phone as is for a night. Let it work all night, and go to bed. If you are lucky, you will have 55% left (because the phone does not drain enough current from charger, so even on charger, the battery voltage goes down - HTC fault). The android issue is that in this specific case, the LED remains solid green. As soon as battery energy is below 100%, the led should turn back to orange. You donQ'Et need to wait over night. Half an hour may be enough to get down to 99 or 98%. But 99% is too much close to Q""EfullQ""E. 55% is really a very low level; a level at which still having a solid green led indicating Q""Echarge compleet, battery fullQ""E is compleetely ... inapropriate, and wrong."

I wanted a lighter touch. I first found that I had to press too hard on screen to click and press things. After installing several development tools, I found a small app that shows any input info about touch layer. This tool prooves that the sensitive layer is sensitive enough ... relatively to my finger. A very light touch does generate events, but, when using the phone in normal mode, light events are cut down by pressure triggers. For me, I would like to make trigger levels smaller. I imagine that other people may find the screen too sensitive, and will wish to make triggers bigger. A new param menu should be set up with those choices: - select screen sensitivity (cursor should be moved by volume buttons) for ordinary actions - select a different sensitivity for the virtual keyboard (I want the keyword to be even more sensitive that rest of interface: I would put trigger at smallest possible value) - select duration of long press for contextual menu Hardware of my HTC Sensation can do.

To replocate the problem, enter into messaging, reply to a message, start the message in portrait (without entering any text, so just select the response box so the keyboard comes up), then turn the phone so that it is landscape mode, start typing text message. Now the first time the backspace key is pressed the Q""EDelete by selectionQ""E screen comes up for messages to be selected that you can delete. This should obviously not come up, what should happen is that the last text entered should be deleted as normal with the backspace key. If landscape mode is switched to before the reply box is entered (before the keyboard is displayed on screen), then this problem does not occur. There has to be an on screen switch from portrait keyboard to landscape keyboard for the bug to happen when the backspace key is pressed. This bug is VERY annoying, if the backspace key is pressed many times then multiple stacked Q""EDelete by selectionQ""E screens are opened, making it difficult to get back to the message usually resulting in going all the way back to the home screen. This basically makes texting with the phone not possible without using a replacement keyboard app such as swype which do not seem to suffer with the problem."

The second is that the volume subroutines are not as isolated from apps as they should be. There is something the apps are allowed to do that might irreversibly affect the volume subroutines, even after being uninstalled.

Open this contact on the phone using Q""EPeopleQ""E or Q""ESearch PeopleQ""E. What happens: Much or all of this information is not provided in the contact details on the phone. Even if you go into edit, these fields cannot be found. What you think the correct behavior should be: Every single field that is in Google should be translated faithfully to the phone. Or at least it should be an option you can turn on. Note there is a similar issue, but it pertains only to birthdays (http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3879). I think the problem is larger than just not mapping birthdays. There are many fields not being mapped."

Because I had doubts about SDcard, I did a compleet badblock check on computer: badblocks -svw /dev/sde . To be sure I would not make any mistake by taking any decision, I choose to insert the white card into the phone, and let it re-partition and format it, the way it wants. I had problems in the past when creating partition table with features not supported by device, or filesystem of unsuported type. After boot, I get warning (this was expected, I am glad Android did not format the card in the go), saying card is empty. I click, and get a pop-up offering me to FORMAT the card, and warning that all data will be lost; I expect that, as usual, by formating, the phone means partitionning. In the particular case of Android 2.3.3 ... this assumpting is wrong. After clicking FORMAT button, I get an other pop-up saying *etat du support externe non reconnu*. As this is very bad french, I expect this to be a very bad literal translation from ... i donQ'Et know what. English version could be: unknown state of external device. In short, it means that on compleetely white card, Android will not take responsability to create a partition tables. For geeks like me, this is fine and cool. But for normal users ... this is not. Normal users can easily get a white card, especially due to various Windows bugs. Several times a year, friends bring me non working external HDDs saying their disk does not work anymore, where I just need to rebuild part table using dedicated tools; not a big deal for me. Personnal story proving that Windows is very good at crashing the PT quiet often. And for those people, Android will be unable to fix Windows issue. A phone is expected to be an autonomous device. My Nokia N95 could take this responsability, and most Canon digital cams also do it. As long as the user has been warned that all data may be lost, it should create the PT. As side note, I shall also say that the French translation for this message makes no sens to me. I do not consider an SDcard as external device; and, i donQ'Et understand what it means by *state*.

This has always worked for me in the past. After doing this, the notification was still present, so I restarted the phone. Still there, so then I went into my apps and moved every possible one to my 32GB SD card... still the notification. So then I deleted some of the larger apps I rarely used, still the notification. After a few days of ignoring it, I noticed it had been a while since I got any gmail notifications. I went digging around and found that it hadnQ'Et synced since the 8th. I went as far as removing my UMD university student email (I could not remove the original one, not allowed) and still nothing would sync.

For example, on a volume rocker that has 100% volume, pressing Down on the rocker would bring the volume down, then to silent, then to vibrate. The only way to achieve complete silence at the moment, is by going into Settings Q>E Sound on my HTC device. I donQ'Et know if this applies to all devices, but if I need to turn all volumes down, I would need to drag the slider, and while I drag, a dynamic volume will adjust to the sliderQ'Es position as I move it to zero.

There are apps that can do it (clocksync) but require root for setting the clock at under 30 second level.

19311,display system,"Wed, 17 Aug 2011 01:51:39 +0000",Japanese phone numbers are reformatted incorrectly,"There are several formats for Japanese phone numbers. For example, the largest cities use 0x-xxxx-xxxx (where each x stands for a numeric digit). As far as I know all mobile phones use a format of 0y0-xxxx-xxxx where the y is 7-9. My office number is 0xx-xxx-xxxx. All of these formats differ from American formats. To reproduce the problem, you enter the phone numbers in their proper local formats, and the phone rearranges things, apparently to American formats. This causes lots of problems since the city codes in Japan have different numbers of digits, and the city codes should only be used for calls placed from other cities. The correct behavior should be that Android should NOT mess with the phone numbers. The local user knows how the phone numbers should appear and the local user wants to see the city code set off properly so as to know how to dial properly. (In terms of behavior it may not matter, since the Japanese phone system can usually ignore an unneeded city code.) My phone is an HTC Aria with Android 2.2. I have not confirmed this misbehavior with people having other kinds of phones, but I can ask around if thatQ'Es relevant. (HTC appears to live by a Q""EWhere is Japan?Q""E policy.) Also, I limited this report to Japanese phone numbers, though IQ'Em sure there are other formats in use in other countries and IQ'Ed bet they have similar problems.

15858,app system,"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 13:17:09 +0000","What do have these in common? Stability, user privacy, battery life: simple solution offered","Hello, Android lacks an important feature, namely user control of start up applications. Hide all the system services, but I should be able to decide what application will start and when. This is clearly needed, the existence of the many task killer applications and the frequent Q""Ewhat is the best task killerQ""E threads on forums proves this beyond doubt. Having this ability would have multiple benefits. To give just a few examples: BATTERY LIFE: - No matter how clever AndroidQ'Es task management is, there are situations which it simply cannot predict. I have a bunch of applications installed which I will never use more than once a month. Why should they ever be loaded without my approval? PRIVACY: - How do I know that the application I just downloaded from Market and keeps starting itself is not spying on me? If applications cannot be turned off, thatQ'Es a huge privacy and security hole. STABILITY: - My brand new HTC IncredibleS crashes every day or two from unknown reasons. One has to remove battery and restart. The official advice from HTC is to perform hard reset of the phone and then install applications back one by one and test which one is causing it. Imagine the alternative: instead of wiping off all user settings, one could instead disable applications one by one at start up. (The HTC advice is odd by the way. In my opinion, if OS an be crashed by a user space application it is not worth a penny.) ****************************************************** PLEASE STAR THIS IF YOU THINK USERS SHOULD HAVE BETTER CONTROL OVER THE RUNNING APPLICATIONS. ******************************************************"

Some discussion of this is going on here: http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/thread?tid=7d3a614dc46f9feaQ&Ehl=en Temporary solution is to downgrade to Google Maps 5.3.1 for anyone experiencing the same problem.
